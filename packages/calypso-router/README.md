# Calypso Router

Calypso Router is a fork of the [page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js) package, with a growing number of optimizations, bugfixes and simplifications (removing unneeded features or compatibility with old browsers) applied on top of the original.

See [page.js documentation](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js) for more information on how to use it.
