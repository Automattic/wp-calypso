# LanguagePicker

A language picker component extracted from Gutenboarding for the purposes of code sharing between Gutenboarding and Calypso.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @automattic/language-picker
```

## Internationalization

This package depends directly on `@wordpress/i18n` for translations and the existence of locale data is assumed. This means consumers must provide the locale data for this package.

## Development Workflow

This package is developed as part of the Calypso monorepo. Run `yarn`
in the root of the repository to get the required `devDependencies`.
