# We REALLY don't want these secrets accidentally getting commited.
# So we take two careful approaches - both by name suffix, and an allowlist in the secrets directory.
# This will protect against accidental moves and renames.
# We use the ** directory match to match these folders in the dist/ directory as well.
# This provides fallback protection if someone were to try to publish the package:
# https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package
