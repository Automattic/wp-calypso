# Packages

This directory exists to hold a variety of projects and libraries that we use in Calypso but also might publish as independent outputs or packages. For now it's empty but we expect a number of separate subdirectories soon.

## Adding a new package?

If you want to add a new project or package into this directory then follow these guidelines to help others who might stumble upon it later.

1. Create a subdirectory with an appropriate descriptive name for what you are writing; contain all of your code in that subdirectory.
2. Add a `README.md` file in that subdirectory explaining what the package is, why it exists, how to install it, and how to use it.
3. Add a terse one-line description and link to the `README.md` file from this page.
