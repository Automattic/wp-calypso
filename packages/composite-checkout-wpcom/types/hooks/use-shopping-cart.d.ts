 * This module provides a hook for manipulating the shopping cart state,

 * communicating with the backend are handled inside the hook. The interface

 *
 *     * isLoading: true if we are loading the cart
 *     * allowedPaymentMethods: the allowed payment method keys
 *     * items: the array of items currently in the cart
 *     * tax: the tax line item
 *     * total: the total price line item
 *     * credits: the credits available as a line item
 *     * addItem: callback for adding an item to the cart
 *     * removeItem: callback for removing an item from the cart

/**
 * Custom hook for managing state in the WPCOM checkout component.
 *
 * We need to allow users to make some simple changes to their
 * shopping cart during checkout; things like deleting items,
 * changing plan lengths, and removing domains. The rules around
 * how these changes can be made are complex and already implemented
 * on the backend via the shopping cart endpoint. So rather than
 * duplicate that logic here we let the server do it for us.
 *
 * The flow goes like this:
 *     1. The host page renders checkout as a component with
 *       this custom hook as a prop, after 'instantiating' it
 *       with REST callback wrappers.
 *     2. This hook maintains a copy of the latest endpoint response
 *       and updates it directly on edit events in checkout.
 *     3. When the cached response cart changes, we fetch an updated
 *       cart from the server and translate it into the format
 *       required by the checkout component. This data is otherwise
 *       not changed.
 *
 * @param cartKey
 *     The cart key. Will use 'no-site' if no key is set.
 * @param setCart
 *     An asynchronous wrapper around the wpcom shopping cart POST
 *     endpoint. We pass this in to make testing easier.
 *     @see WPCOM_JSON_API_Me_Shopping_Cart_Endpoint
 * @param getCart
 *     An asynchronous wrapper around the wpcom shopping cart GET
 *     endpoint. We pass this in to make testing easier.
 *     @see WPCOM_JSON_API_Me_Shopping_Cart_Endpoint
 * @returns ShoppingCartManager
