/**
 * This set of reporters try to detect if the tab/window was 'hidden' at any point during the report duration.
 * It doesn't care about the current state or when it becomes 'visible', that's why we don't listen for that
 * state change.
 *
 * It is not perfect because it can't detect if the tab/window was hidden between the page laod and when the
 * start collector is called.
 *
 * It also assumes there is only one report running. If we ever have more than one, we may have problems when
 * unsubscribing from the `visibilitychange` event.
