# Verbum Block Editor

Verbum Block Editor is a lightweight Gutenberg editor designed specifically for comments. It provides a simplified and intuitive interface for users to compose and format their comments effortlessly.

## Features

- Autofocus on the last block when the empty white space is clicked.
- Autofocus on the first paragraph on load.
- Handles embeds by adding all the needed API middlewares.
- Uses and iframed editor to limit CSS collisions.

## WIP
Soon, this will be published on NPM and used everywhere a user can edit comments (in Verbum and in Calypso's `/comments/all/` page).
