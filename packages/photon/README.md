# Photon.js

JavaScript library for the [WordPress.com][] [Photon][] image manipulation service.

## Requirements

Photon.js requires support for the standard URL and URLSearchParams APIs.
Be sure to use a polyfill if you're targetting environments without support for them. This includes old browsers, such
as Internet Explorer 11, and old versions of Node.js (5 or older).

## How to use

Install via `npm`:

```bash
yarn add photon
```

Import the `photon` method into your module.

For CommonJS:

```js
const photon = require( 'photon' );
```

For ES Modules:

```js
import photon from 'photon';
```

Then use the imported method to generate Photon URLs:

```js
const url = photon( 'https://wordpress.org/style/images/wporg-logo.svg' );

console.log( url );
// https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/style/images/wporg-logo.svg?ssl=1
```
