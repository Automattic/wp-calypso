# Material design icons

This package currently only provides Material icon SVGs required by the Calypso
nav drawer. The official `material-design-icons` package (<https://github.com/google/material-design-icons>)
is generally quite out-dated. It also includes many image formats that are not
relevant to Calypso.

As we adopt Material icons more widely, it will probably be worthwhile to fully
populate this package with all the available icons. Alternatively, we could seek
out an alternative distribution of the icons.

## Using a Material icon in Calypso

We use `svgr` to load SVG files and convert them to React components:

```jsx
import { ReactComponent as SvgExample } from './test.svg';

<SvgExample />;
```

## Adding a new Material icon

To add more icons, you'll have to download individual icons to the appropriate directories,
then rebuild and commit the updated sprites file:

  1. Search for an icon in the [official repository](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons), minding the style (like `outline`)

  2. Select an icon, and download the corresponding `SVG` file with `black` as color
     > Beware that the default style and size for the `MaterialIcon` class is `outline` and `24`

  3. Move that `SVG` file in the sub-folder matching the category of that icon
     > The category should be one of the categories listed in the select box of the search form

  4. Rebuild `material-icons.svg` by running:
     ```bash
     yarn workspace @automattic/material-design-icons run build
     ```
