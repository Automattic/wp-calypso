# calypso-mp-data-analysis

This package contains NodeJS scripts which derive the top products from the `top-100-searches.csv` file. This file should be a csv containing a `search_term` column, a `count` column and a `language` column.

To generate the csv reports navigate into this repo and run `yarn generate` the results will appear under `results/`.
