# Composite Checkout

A set of React components, custom Hooks, and helper functions that together can be used to create a purchase and checkout flow.

## Installation

**This package is still in development and not yet published.**

Once published, you'll be able to install this package using npm with:

`npm install @automattic/composite-checkout`

## Description

This package provides a context provider, `CheckoutProvider`, and a default component, `Checkout`, which creates a checkout form.

The form has two default steps:

1. Payment method
2. Review order

These steps can be customized or replaced, and additional steps can be added.

It's also possible to build an entirely custom form using the other components exported by this package.

## How to use this package

Most components of this package require being inside a [CheckoutProvider](#checkoutprovider). That component requires an array of [Payment Method objects](#payment-methods) which define the available payment methods (stripe credit cards, apple pay, paypal, credits, etc.) that will be displayed in the form. While you can create these objects manually, the package provides many pre-defined payment method objects that can be created by using the functions [createStripeMethod](#createstripemethod), [createApplePayMethod](#createapplepaymethod), [createPayPalMethod](#createpaypalmethod), [createFullCreditsMethod](#createFullCreditsMethod), and [createExistingCardMethod](#createExistingCardMethod).

Any component which is a child of `CheckoutProvider` gets access to the custom hooks [useAllPaymentMethods](#useAllPaymentMethods), [useEvents](#useEvents), [useFormStatus](#useFormStatus), [useMessages](#useMessages), [useDispatch](#useDispatch), [useLineItems](#useLineItems), [usePaymentMethod](#usePaymentMethodId), [usePaymentMethodId](#usePaymentMethodId), [useRegisterStore](#useRegisterStore), [useRegistry](#useRegistry), [useSelect](#useSelect), and [useTotal](#useTotal).

The [Checkout](#checkout) component creates the form itself. Within the component's children, you can render elements to create the checkout experience. Any child is allowed but the [CheckoutStepBody](#CheckoutStepBody) component can be used to render something that looks like a checkout step. A series of these can be used to create a semantic form. If you would like to have a series of steps that are joined by "Continue" buttons which are hidden and displayed as needed, you can instead use the [CheckoutSteps](#CheckoutSteps) component with [CheckoutStep](#CheckoutStep) children that will take care of the logic for you.

Each `CheckoutStep` has a `isCompleteCallback` prop, which will be called when the "Continue" button is pressed. It can perform validation on that step's contents to determine if the form should continue to the next step. If the function returns true, the form continues to the next step, otherwise it remains on the same step. If the function returns a `Promise`, then the "Continue" button will change to "Please waitâ€¦" until the Promise resolves allowing for async operations. The value resolved by the Promise must be a boolean; true to continue, false to stay on the current step.

Any component within a `CheckoutStep` gets access to the custom hooks above as well as [useIsStepActive](#useIsStepActive) and [useIsStepComplete](#useIsStepComplete).

## Submitting the form

When the payment button is pressed, the form data will be validated and submitted in a way appropriate to the payment method. If there is a problem with either validation or submission, or if the payment method's service returns an error, the `showErrorMessage` prop on `Checkout` will be called with an object describing the error.

If the payment method succeeds, the `onPaymentComplete` prop will be called instead.

## Example

See the [demo](demo/index.js) for an example of using this package.

## Styles and Themes

Each component will be styled using [@emotion/styled](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) and many of the styles will be editable by passing a `theme` object to the `CheckoutProvider`.

For style customization beyond what is available in the theme, each component will also include a unique static className using BEM syntax.

When using the individual API components, you can also pass a `className` prop, which will be applied to that component in addition to the above.

## Payment Methods

Each payment method is an object with the following properties:

- `id: string`. A unique id.
- `label: React.ReactNode`. A component that displays that payment method selection button which can be as simple as the name and an icon.
- `activeContent: React.ReactNode`. A component that displays that payment method (this can return null or something like a credit card form).
- `submitButton: React.ReactNode`. A component button that is used to submit the payment method. This button should include a click handler that performs the actual payment process. When disabled, it will be provided with the `disabled` prop and must disable the button.
- `inactiveContent: React.ReactNode`. A component that renders a summary of the selected payment method when the step is inactive.
- `getAriaLabel: (localize: () => string) => string`. A function to return the name of the Payment Method. It will receive the localize function as an argument.
- `isCompleteCallback?: () => boolean | Promise<boolean>`. Used to determine if a step is complete for purposes of validation. Default is a function returning true.

Within the components, the Hook `usePaymentMethod()` will return an object of the above form with the key of the currently selected payment method or null if none is selected. To retrieve all the payment methods and their properties, the Hook `useAllPaymentMethods()` will return an array that contains them all.

When the `submitButton` component has been clicked, it should use the functions provided by [useFormStatus](#useFormStatus) to change the status to 'submitting'. If there is a problem, it should change the status back to 'ready' and display an appropriate error using [useMessages](#useMessages). If the payment is successful, it should change the status to 'complete', which will cause [Checkout](#Checkout) to call `onPaymentComplete` (see [CheckoutProvider](#CheckoutProvider)).

## Line Items

Each item is an object with the following properties:

- `id: string`. A unique identifier for this line item within the array of line items. Do not use the product id; never assume that only one instance of a particular product is present.
- `type: string`. Not used internally but can be used to organize line items (eg: `tax` for a VAT line item).
- `label: string`. The displayed title of the line item.
- `subLabel?: string`. An optional subtitle for the line item.
- `amount: { currency: string, value: number, displayValue: string }`. The price of the line item. For line items without a price, set value to 0 and displayValue to an empty string.

The `displayValue` property can use limited Markdown formatting, including the `~~` characters for strike-through text. When rendering `displayValue`, the property should be passed through the `renderDisplayValueMarkdown()` helper.

## Data Stores

Each Payment Method or component can create a Redux-like data store by using the `registerStore` function. Code can then access that data by using `dispatch`, `select`, and `subscribe`. These functions can be accessed by calling the `useRegistry` hook. Components can most easily use the data with the `useDispatch` and `useSelect` hooks. Read the [@wordpress/data](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/packages/packages-data/) docs to learn more about the details of this system.

In addition to the features of that package, we provide a `useRegisterStore` hook which takes the same arguments as `registerStore` and will allow creating a new store just before a component first renders.

The registry used for these stores is created by default but you can use a custom one by including the `registry` prop on `CheckoutProvider`. If you want to use the default registry, you can import it directly from this package using [#defaultRegistry](defaultRegistry), and for convenience, [#registerStore](registerStore).

## API

While the `Checkout` component takes care of most everything, there are many situations where its appearance and behavior will be customized. In these cases it's appropriate to use the underlying building blocks of this package.

### Checkout

The main wrapper component for the checkout form. It has the following props.

- `className?: string`. The className for the component.

### CheckoutProvider

Renders its `children` prop and acts as a React Context provider. All of checkout should be wrapped in this.

It has the following props.

- `locale: string`. A [BCP 47 language tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#locales_argument).
- `items: object[]`. An array of [line item objects](#line-items) that will be displayed in the form.
- `total: object`. A [line item object](#line-items) with the final total to be paid.
- `theme?: object`. A [theme object](#styles-and-themes).
- `onPaymentComplete: ({paymentMethodId: string}) => null`. A function to call for non-redirect payment methods when payment is successful. Passed the current payment method id.
- `showErrorMessage: (string) => null`. A function that will display a message with an "error" type.
- `showInfoMessage: (string) => null`. A function that will display a message with an "info" type.
- `showSuccessMessage: (string) => null`. A function that will display a message with a "success" type.
- `onEvent?: (action) => null`. A function called for all sorts of events in the code. The callback will be called with a [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action).
- `paymentMethods: object[]`: An array of [Payment Method objects](#payment-methods).
- `registry?: object`. An object returned by [createRegistry](#createRegistry). If not provided, the default registry will be used.
- `isLoading?: boolean`. If set and true, the form will be replaced with a loading placeholder.

The line items are for display purposes only. They should also include subtotals, discounts, and taxes. No math will be performed on the line items. Instead, the amount to be charged will be specified by the required prop `total`, which is another line item.

## CheckoutStep

A checkout step. This should be a direct child of [CheckoutSteps](#CheckoutSteps) and is itself a wrapper for [CheckoutStepBody](#CheckoutStepBody). If you want to make something that looks like a step but is not connected to other steps, use a [CheckoutStepBody](#CheckoutStepBody) instead.

This component's props are:

- `stepId: string`. A unique ID for the step.
- `className?: string`. A className for the step wrapper.
- `titleContent: React.ReactNode`. Displays as the title of the step.
- `activeStepContent?: React.ReactNode`. Displays as the content of the step when it is active. It is also displayed when the step is inactive but is hidden by CSS.
- `completeStepContent?: React.ReactNode`. Displays as the content of the step when it is inactive and complete as defined by the `isCompleteCallback`.
- `isCompleteCallback: () => boolean | Promise<boolean>`. Used to determine if a step is complete for purposes of validation.
- `editButtonAriaLabel?: string`. Used to fill in the `aria-label` attribute for the "Edit" button if one exists.
- `nextStepButtonAriaLabel?: string`. Used to fill in the `aria-label` attribute for the "Continue" button if one exists.
- `editButtonText?: string`. Used in place of "Edit" on the edit step button.
- `nextStepButtonText?: string`. Used in place of "Continue" on the next step button.
- `validatingButtonText?: string`. Used in place of "Please waitâ€¦" on the next step button when `isCompleteCallback` returns an unresolved Promise.
- `validatingButtonAriaLabel:? string`. Used for the `aria-label` attribute on the next step button when `isCompleteCallback` returns an unresolved Promise.

## CheckoutStepBody

A component that looks like a checkout step. Normally you don't need to use this directly, since [CheckoutStep](#CheckoutStep) creates this for you, but you can use it manually if you wish.

- `stepId: string`. A unique ID for this step.
- `isStepActive: boolean`. True if the step should be rendered as active. Renders `activeStepContent`.
- `isStepComplete: boolean`. True if the step should be rendered as complete. Renders `completeStepContent`.
- `stepNumber: number`. The step number to display for the step.
- `totalSteps: number`. The total number of steps in the current connected group of steps.
- `errorMessage?: string`. The error message to display in the React error boundary if there is an error thrown by any component in this step.
- `editButtonText?: string`. The text to display instead of "Edit" for the edit step button.
- `editButtonAriaLabel?: string`. The text to display for `aria-label` instead of "Edit" for the edit step button.

- `nextStepButtonAriaLabel?: string`. Like `editButtonAriaLabel` but for the "Continue" button.
- `validatingButtonText?: string`. Like `editButtonText` but for the "Please waitâ€¦" button when `formStatus` is `validating`.
- `validatingButtonAriaLabel?: string`. Like `editButtonAriaLabel` but for the "Please waitâ€¦" button.
- `className?: string`. A className for the component.
- `goToThisStep?: () => void`. A function to be called when the "Edit" button is pressed.
- `goToNextStep?: () => void`. A function to be called when the "Continue" button is pressed.
- `nextStepNumber?: number`. The step number of the step that will be active after the "Continue" button is pressed.
- `formStatus?: string`. The current form status. See [useFormStatus](#useFormStatus).
- `titleContent: React.ReactNode`. Displays as the title of the step.
- `activeStepContent?: React.ReactNode`. Displays as the content of the step when it is active. It is also displayed when the step is inactive but is hidden by CSS.
- `completeStepContent?: React.ReactNode`. Displays as the content of the step when it is inactive and complete as defined by `isStepComplete` and `isStepActive`.

## CheckoutSteps

A wrapper for [CheckoutStep](#CheckoutStep) objects that will connect the steps and provide a way to switch between them. Should be a direct child of [Checkout](#Checkout).

### CheckoutReviewOrder

Renders a list of the line items and their `displayValue` properties followed by the `total` line item, and whatever `submitButton` is in the current payment method.

### OrderReviewLineItems

Renders a list of line items passed in the `items` prop. Each line item must have at least the props `label`, `id`, and `amount.displayValue`.

An optional boolean prop, `collapsed`, can be used to simplify the output for when the review section is collapsed.

This component provides just a simple list of label and price. If you want to modify how each line item is displayed, or if you want to provide any actions for that item (eg: the ability to delete the item from the order), you cannot use this component; instead you should create a custom component.

### OrderReviewSection

A wrapper for a section of a list of related line items. Renders its `children` prop.

### OrderReviewTotal

Renders the `total` prop like a line item, but with different styling.

An optional boolean prop, `collapsed`, can be used to simplify the output for when the review section is collapsed.

## FAQ

### How do I use Credits and Coupons?

Credits, coupons, and discounts are all ways that the line items and the total can be modified, so they must be handled by the parent component.

### Do line items need to be products?

No, line items can be anything. The most common use is for products, taxes, subtotals, discounts, and other adjustments to the total price. However, line items can also contain other information that you'd like to display in the review step. If you customize the Order Review step, you will also be able to decide how each line item is presented. Just be aware that line items may be passed along to the server when the purchase is made, depending on the payment method. Check the documentation for each payment method to determine if there are any specific requirements there.

### Do line items amount properties have to have an integer value?

The primary properties used in a line item by default are `id` (which must be unique), `label` (with an optional `subLabel`), and `amount.displayValue`. The other properties (`type`, `amount.currency`, `amount.value`) are not used outside custom implementations, but it's highly recommended that you provide them. As requirements and customizations change, it can be helpful to have a way to perform calculations, conversions, and sorting on line items, which will require those fields. If any required field is undefined, an error will be thrown to help notice these errors as soon as possible.

### Can I add custom properties to line items?

If you need specific custom data as part of a line item so that it can be used in another part of the form, you can add new properties to the line item objects.

## Development

In the root of the monorepo, run `npm run composite-checkout-demo` which will start a local webserver that will display the component.

To run the tests for this package, run `npm run test-packages composite-checkout`.
