# Components

A library of React components designed for use in Automattic products.

## Installation

Install the components and the color schemes they depend on.

// import the color variables - you only need to do this once in your entire application
import '@automattic/calypso-color-schemes';

// import the component you wish to use
import { Button } from '@automattic/components';

const CallToAction = () => (
	<>
		<Button primary onClick={ () => alert( 'Thank you for taking action!' ) }>
			Take action now!
		</Button>
	</>
);
```
