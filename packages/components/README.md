# Components

A library of React components designed for use in Automattic products.

## Installation

Install the components and the color schemes they depend on.

npm i -S @automattic/components @automattic/calypso-color-schemes

import '@automattic/calypso-color-schemes';

// import the component you wish to use
import { Button } from '@automattic/components';

const CallToAction = () => (
	<>
		<Button primary onClick={() => alert('Thank you for taking action!')}>Take action now!</Button>
	</>
);

```
