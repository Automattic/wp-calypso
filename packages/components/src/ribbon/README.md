# Ribbon (JSX)

Ribbon is a component you can slap on a Card or a similar container to distinguish it in
some way. Ribbons came to us in the early 2010s when they were put on every container on the web.
Since then, the internetâ€™s love for ribbons have subsided, but they will always find a
place in our hearts.
