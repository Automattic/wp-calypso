* Following the [files](https://github.com/Automattic/color-studio/blob/master/dist/color-properties.css) [generated](https://github.com/Automattic/color-studio/blob/master/dist/color-properties-rgb.css) by Color Studio, updated all properties to use consistent names (including index numbers).
* Phased out all SCSS variables in favor of CSS custom properties.
* Refactored the existing component-specific properties and prefixed all theme variables with `--color`.
* Introduced `-inverted` properties.
* Split all color schemes into separate partial files.
