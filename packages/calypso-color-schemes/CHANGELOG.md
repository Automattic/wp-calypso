This update brings backwards-incompatible changes to the package. The most notable ones include:

- Updated [Color Studio](https://color-studio.blog), the primary dependency, to the most recent version.
- Following the [files](https://github.com/Automattic/color-studio/blob/HEAD/dist/color-properties.css) [generated](https://github.com/Automattic/color-studio/blob/HEAD/dist/color-properties-rgb.css) by Color Studio, updated all properties to use consistent names (including index numbers).
- Phased out all SCSS variables in favor of CSS custom properties.
- Refactored the existing component-specific properties and prefixed all theme variables with `--color`.
- Introduced semantic `-inverted` properties which are the successor to `--color-white`.
- Split all color schemes into separate partial files.
