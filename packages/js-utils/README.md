# JavaScript utils

This is a collection of general purpose JavaScript utility functions.

## Important note

This package was created to help with Lodash removal in Calypso in the first place and is currently
not intended to be used outside of Calypso. Functions currently in here may be removed in the future
without further notice.

Second, we want to think very carefully about what functions to add and which not. A lot of Lodash
functionality these days can be replaced by native JavaScript code and that should be the premise.
In case you still want to add a function here please open a Pull Request which describes your use-case
and ping @Automattic/team-calypso for a review.
