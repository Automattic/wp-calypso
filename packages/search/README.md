# Search

A search input component.

## Installation

Install the component.

```bash
yarn add @automattic/search
```

## Internationalization

This package depends directly on `@wordpress/i18n` for translations. This means consumers must provide locale data prior to using the component.

## Development Workflow

This package is developed as part of the Calypso monorepo. Run `yarn`
in the root of the repository to get the required `devDependencies`.
