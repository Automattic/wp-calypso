// A "block" is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that,
// when composed together, form the content or layout of a page.
// The API for blocks is exposed via `wp.blocks`.
//
// Supported blocks are registered by calling `registerBlockType`. Once registered,
// the block is made available as an option to the editor interface.
//
// Blocks are inferred from the HTML source of a post through a parsing mechanism
// and then stored as objects in state, from which it is then rendered for editing.
