# Calypso

Calypso is the new WordPress.com front-end – a beautiful redesign of the WordPress dashboard using a single-page web application, powered by the WordPress.com REST API. Calypso is built for reading, writing, and managing all of your WordPress sites in one place.

It’s built with JavaScript – a very light [node](https://nodejs.org) plus [express](http://expressjs.com) server, [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [wpcom.js](http://wpcomjs.com), and many other wonderful libraries on the front-end.

You can read more about Calypso at [developer.wordpress.com/calypso](https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/).

## Getting Started

You can try out the user-side of Calypso on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) (a lot of the logged-in area is Calypso; if in doubt, view source), you can poke around the code here on GitHub, or you can install it and run it locally. The latter is the most fun.

1.	Make sure you have `git`, `node`, and `npm` installed.
2.	Clone this repository locally.
3.	Add `127.0.0.1 calypso.localhost` to your local `hosts` file.
4.	Execute `npm start` or `npm run dashboard` (for a more visually-oriented interface) from the root directory of the repository.
5.	Open [`calypso.localhost:3000`](http://calypso.localhost:3000/) in your browser.
