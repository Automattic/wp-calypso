* `full-site-editing-plugin` - this is a master Plugin containing:

## Build System

Note: these scripts must be run from the Calypso _root_ directory.

- `npx lerna run dev --scope='@automattic/full-site-editing'`<br>
Compiles both the theme and the plugins, and watches for changes.

- `npx lerna run build --scope='@automattic/full-site-editing'`<br>
Compiles and minifies for production both the theme and the plugins.

Both these scripts will also move all source and PHP files into `/dist` in their respective folders.

The entry points are:

- __Theme__: `/blank-theme/index.js`
- __Plugin__: `/full-site-editing-plugin/{{plugin-directory}}/index.js`

The outputs are:

- __Theme__: `/blank-theme/dist`
- __Plugin__: `/full-site-editing-plugin/{{plugin-directory}}/dist`

### Building Individual _Plugins_

You can also build one of the Plugins separately by appending the plugin slug onto the `build` portion of the command. eg: 

```
// Builds the `posts-list-block` Plugin only
npx lerna run build:posts-list-block --scope='@automattic/full-site-editing'`
```

## Local Development

Build (or `run dev`) and symlink both the theme and the plugin into a local WordPress install.

E.g.

```
npx lerna run build --scope='@automattic/full-site-editing'

ln -s ~/Dev/wp-calypso/apps/full-site-editing/full-site-editing-plugin/ ~/Dev/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/full-site-editing-plugin

ln -s ~/Dev/wp-calypso/apps/full-site-editing/blank-theme/ ~/Dev/wordpress/wp-content/themes/blank-theme
```

Note that if you are using Docker symlinks will not work. Instead you will need to mount the Plugin as a volume.
