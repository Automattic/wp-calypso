# Block Inserter Modifications

## New Blocks Showcase

This [script](./new-blocks-showcase.js) is responsible for adding the "New" section to the Block Inserter and filling that section with 6 recently added blocks that we want to highlight. Currently, these blocks have to be defined manually via the `NEW_BLOCKS` array, which you'll find inside the [`new-blocks-showcase.js`](./new-blocks-showcase.js) file.
