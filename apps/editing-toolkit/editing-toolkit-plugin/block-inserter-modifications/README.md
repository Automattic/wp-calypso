# Block Inserter Modifications

## New Blocks Showcase

* [new-blocks-showcase](./new-blocks-showcase.js) is responsible for adding: the "New" section to the Block Inserter and filling that section with 6 recently added blocks that we want to highlight. Currently, these blocks have to be defined manually via the `NEW_BLOCKS` array, which you'll find inside the [`new-blocks-showcase.js`](./new-blocks-showcase.js) file.
* [new-blocks-showcase](./contextual-tips.js) add Tips to the searcher box when the term matches with some of the keywords defined by the component.
