# Block Patterns

## Adding a new pattern

Please add any new block pattern to the `patterns` folder within this module.
Every file in that folder gets automatically included registered as a block pattern.

There are two ways to add a new pattern, depending on whether it contains text or images that need to be localized:

1. A json file for static block patterns.
1. A php file for dynamic block patterns that need localization.

Please refer the Image and Description pattern as an example for a dynamic pattern that needs translation.
