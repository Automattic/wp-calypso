# WP.com Global Styles

Functionality that limits the Global Styles feature on WordPress.com sites to paid plans.

## Highlights

- The site editor displays a modal after opening the Global Styles panel to alert customers that it is a paid feature.
- When the site's plan isn't a paid plan we will override the Global Styles loaded and will return the default Global Styles for the active theme.
- The pre-save panel of the site editor displays a notice to alert customers that any Global Styles change won't be public.
