# Apps

This directory exists to hold a variety of projects that we do not use directly in Calypso and publish as independent outputs or packages.

For packages that are used also in Calypso, see [`/packages`](../packages)

## Adding a new app?

If you want to add a new project into this directory, then add a new directory and follow [Publishing with the Monorepo](../docs/monorepo.md) -documentation.
