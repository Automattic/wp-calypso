#### Things to check

Here are some important things to check on each PR as an author and reviewer.

- [ ] Have you written new tests for your changes?
- [ ] Have you tested the feature in Simple, Atomic, and self-hosted Jetpack sites?
- [ ] Are there any TypeScript or console errors?
- [ ] Are we memoizing when appropriate (for expensive computations)?
- [ ] Have we sent any new strings for translation ASAP?
