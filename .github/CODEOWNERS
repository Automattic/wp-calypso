# We use codeowners to help keep teams in the loop on changes to code 
# they typically work on. Even though this file is called CODEOWNERS, 
# we don't really want to enforce or imply ownership of code, just interest. 
#
# Anyone can work on anything. 
#
# Prefer associating a "team" with a path rather than an individual. That allows individuals to 
# move around without having to continually update this file.
