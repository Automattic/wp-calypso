### Log filters to discard irrelevant warnings. ###
logFilters:
# WordPress packages often have transitive dependencies with incorrect react-related peer dependencies.
# This matcher discards those log messages, while allowing non-react or non-wordpress related violations
# to be handled separately. (For example, npm packages can be handled via packageExtensions.)
#
# WordPress will need to update/change the following packages to versions which include React 18 support,
# and then we'll need to update to those WordPress package versions before we can remove this.
# - react-autosize-textarea@npm:7.1.0
# - reakit-system@npm:0.15.2
# - reakit-utils@npm:0.15.2
# - reakit-warning@npm:0.6.2
# - reakit@npm:1.3.11
#
# The matcher works like so:
# 1. Match any workspace package, such as @automattic/global-styles@workspace, calypso@workspace, happy-blocks@workspace
# 2. Match any path within the workspace, such as @workspace:packages/page-pattern-modal [cd6b3], @workspace::apps/editing-toolkit, @workspace:client, or @workspace:.
# 3. Match a react or react-dom on the current version which a workspace package provides.
# 4. Match only violations coming from within @wordpress packages.
  - level: discard
    pattern: "+(react|react-dom) is listed by your project with version 18.2.0, which doesn't satisfy what +(@wordpress/*|@types/wordpress__*) and other dependencies request*"

# TODO: Remove this once Reakit can be removed (or once Reakit includes React 18 as a peer dependency.)
  - level: discard
    pattern: "react-dom is listed by your project with version 18.2.0, which doesn't satisfy what reakit*"
