### Log filters to discard irrelevant warnings. ###
logFilters:
# WordPress packages often have transitive dependencies with incorrect react-related peer dependencies.
# This matcher discards those log messages, while allowing non-react or non-wordpress related violations
# to be handled separately. (For example, npm packages can be handled via packageExtensions.)
#
# WordPress will need to update/change the following packages to versions which include React 18 support,
# and then we'll need to update to those WordPress package versions before we can remove this.
# - react-autosize-textarea@npm:7.1.0
#
# The matcher works like so:
# 1. Match any workspace package, such as @automattic/global-styles@workspace, calypso@workspace, happy-blocks@workspace
# 2. Match any path within the workspace, such as @workspace:packages/page-pattern-modal [cd6b3], @workspace::apps/editing-toolkit, @workspace:client, or @workspace:.
# 3. Match a react or react-dom on the current version which a workspace package provides.
# 4. Match only violations coming from within @wordpress packages.
