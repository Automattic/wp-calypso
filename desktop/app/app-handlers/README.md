# App Handlers

App handlers are bits of code that run before the app is started and the main window has opened. Code here cannot use window or dialog functions.

The following handlers are available:

- [Crash Reporting](crash-reporting/README.md)
- [Exceptions](exceptions/README.md)
- [Preferences](preferences/README.md)
- [Printer](printer/README.md)
- [Secrets](secrets/README.md)
- [Updater](updater/README.md)
