			 * We download the archive directly in this step rather than relying on
			 * an artifact dependency. We do this because if two commits on trunk
			 * build at the same time, then they will both point to the same artifact
			 * dependency. In this scenario, we actually want the current build to
			 * diff against the artifact from that other commit build.
			 *
			 * Using the artifact dependency feature, we can only rely on already-finished
			 * builds at the time the current build *starts*. This means every build
			 * would have to run in serial, which is not possible in TeamCity without
			 * a plugin. As a result, commits have to happen several minutes apart
			 * in order for the diff tagging feature to work correctly in this scenario.
			 *
			 * Downloading from the API directly means that the previous build only
			 * has to finish by the time this *step* begins. As a result, as long as
			 * the two builds start further apart than the time this step takes,
			 * then we can diff against the correct artifact. This means two builds
			 * can be started within a few seconds of each other on trunk, and the
			 * most recent build of the two can still rely on the other's artifact.
