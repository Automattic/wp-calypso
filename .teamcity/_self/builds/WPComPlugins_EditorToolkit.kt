		 * We download the archive directly in this step rather than relying on
		 * an artifact dependency. We do this because if two commits on trunk
		 * build at the same time, then they will both point to the same artifact
		 * dependency. In this scenario, we actually want the current build to
		 * diff against the artifact from that other commit build.
		 * 
		 * Using the artifact dependency feature, we can only rely on already-finished
		 * builds at the time the current build *starts*. This means every build
		 * would have to run in serial, which is not possible in TeamCity without
		 * a plugin. As a result, commits have to happen several minutes apart
		 * in order for the diff tagging feature to work correctly in this scenario.
		 * 
		 * Downloading from the API directly means that the previous build only
		 * has to finish by the time this *step* begins. As a result, as long as
		 * the two builds start further apart than the time this step takes,
		 * then we can diff against the correct artifact. This means two builds
		 * can be started within a few seconds of each other on trunk, and the
		 * most recent build of the two can still rely on the other's artifact.
