<!-- /TOC -->

The environment configuration for these tests comes from two different sources: environment variables and an encrypted secrets file.

## Environment Variables

Most non-sensitive runtime configuration comes from environment variables. All of our environment variables have fallback defaults that can be overriden.

For example:

```
VIEWPORT_NAME=mobile yarn jest specs/<etc>
```

For a list of supported environment variables, please refer to [this page](environment_variables.md).

Environment variable values are presented with static typings through the [`env-variables.ts`](../../../packages/calypso-e2e//src/env-variables.ts) module.

To use:

```typescript
import { envVariables } from '@automattic/calypso-e2e';

// Later

if ( envVariables.VIEWPORT_NAME === 'mobile' ) {
	// Do x ;
}
```

## Secrets File

### Decrypting the Secrets

Within `@automattic/calypso-e2e/src/secrets` is an encrypted file that holds various sensitive secrets, such as API keys and test account information. This must be decrypted prior to use.

To decrypt the secrets, set the environment variable `E2E_SECRETS_KEY` to the secret from the Automattic secret store.

```
export E2E_SECRETS_KEY='<secret key from the secret store>'
```

Then, either here or in the `@automattic/calypso-e2e` workspace, run `yarn decrypt-secrets`.

**The decrypted version of these secrets must NEVER be committed. There are .gitignore rules to protect against this, but be vigilant nonetheless!**

**Automatticians**: please refer to the Field Guide page for instructions on decrypting/encrypting this file. 

**Trialmatticians**: please contact a team member in your Slack chat for the decryption key.

### Using the Secrets

The secrets are read and validated at runtime. They are accessed through the [`SecretsManager`](../../../packages/calypso-e2e/src/secrets/secrets-manager.ts) static class, which presents the secrets with static typings.

To use:

```typescript
import { SecretsManager } from '@automattic/calypso-e2e';

// Later

const x = SecretsManager.secrets.keyName

```
