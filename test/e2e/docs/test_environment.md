The environment configuration for these tests comes from two different sources: environment variables and an encrypted secrets file.

## Environment Variables

Most non-sensitive runtime configuration comes from environment variables. All of our environment variables have fallback defaults.

For example:

```
VIEWPORT_NAME=mobile yarn jest specs/<etc>
```

The list of supported environment variables are found in [`env-variables.ts`](../../../packages/calypso-e2e//src/env-variables.ts). This file also adds static type checking and is the most up-to-date resource. The [Environment Variables](./environment_variables.md) page may be out of date but will contain explanations of what the individual variables mean.

To use:

```typescript
import { envVariables } from '@automattic/calypso-e2e';

// Later

if ( envVariables.VIEWPORT_NAME === 'mobile' ) {
	// Do x ;
}
```

## Secrets File

### Decrypting the Secrets

Within `@automattic/calypso-e2e/src/secrets` is an encrypted file that holds various sensitive secrets, such as API keys and test account information. This must be decrypted prior to use.

**Automatticians**: please refer to the [Field Guide page](PCYsg-vnR-p2) for more information.

**Trialmatticians**: please contact a team member in your Slack chat for the decryption key.

First set the environment variable `E2E_SECRETS_KEY` to the "Calypso E2E Config decode key" from the Automattic secret store.

```bash
export E2E_SECRETS_KEY='<Calypso E2E Config decode key from the secret store>'
```

Then run the following command to decrypt the secrets:

```bash
# If within test/e2e directory
yarn decrypt-secrets

# If at repo root
yarn workspace wp-e2e-tests decrypt-secrets
```

The decrypted file must **NEVER be committed.** There are `.gitignore` rules to protect against this, but be vigilant nonetheless!

### Using the Secrets

The secrets are read and validated at runtime. They are accessed through the [`SecretsManager`](../../../packages/calypso-e2e/src/secrets/secrets-manager.ts) static class, which presents the secrets with static typings.

To use:

```typescript
import { SecretsManager } from '@automattic/calypso-e2e';

// Later in the spec

const credentials = SecretsManager.secrets.testAccounts.<test_account_name>;

```
