# Writing Tests

This document will outline tips to write successful tests for both Selenium and Playwright suites.

Refer to the [Playwright style guide](docs/style-guide-playwright.md) for more information.

## Get Started

Tests can be written in both TypeScript and JavaScript.

### 1. Create a spec file with the following structure

```
test/e2e/specs/specs-playwright/wp-<major feature>__<subfeature>.ts
```

This is for multiple reasons:

- grouping of test specs by feature.
- separation of subfeatures into separate files to take advantage of parallelization.

### 2. Assign the spec file to the appropriate suites

Specs are grouped into suites using [jest-runner-groups](https://github.com/eugene-manuilov/jest-runner-groups). **Specs must be explicitly added to suites to be run as part of CI pipelines.**  
To add your spec file to suites, add a jsdoc block at the top of the file, and use the `@group` tag for each suite.

```typescript
/**
 * @group calypso-pr
 * @group gutenberg
 */
```

The current suites used are...
- `calypso-pr` - tests run pre-merge on every Calypso PR.
- `gutenberg` - WPCOM focused tests run as part of Gutenberg upgrades.


### 3. Import the basics

```typescript
import { setupHooks, DataHelper, LoginFlow } from '@automattic/calypso-e2e';
```

## Top-level block

As referenced in the [Style Guide](style-guide-playwright.md#Tests), there should only be one top-level `describe` block in a spec file.

Using the `DataHelper.createSuiteTitle` function, define a short, descriptive name for the overall suite:

```typescript
describe( DataHelper.createSuiteTitle( 'Feature' ), function () {} );
```

## Child-level block

Unlike top-level blocks, there are no restrictions on the number of child-level `describe` blocks.

> :warning: while there are no limits to the number of child blocks, exercise restraint - child blocks run sequentially, so if a file takes 8 minutes to complete the CI task will inevitably take that long!

Using child-level `describe` blocks, group distinct test cases for the feature. Do not use `DataHelper.createSuiteTitle` for child-level blocks:

```typescript
describe( DataHelper.createSuiteTitle( 'Feature' ), function() {
	describe( 'Use Feature with valid string', function() {});

	describe( 'Use Feature with invalid string', function() {});

	describe( 'Deactivate Feature', funtion() {});
})
```

## Setup

With Playwright, the `page` instance lives until it is closed or crashes. As such, the same `page` instance can be used throughout the test.

Invoke the `setupHooks` call to obtain an instance of a `Page` object:

```typescript
describe( DataHelper.createSuiteTitle( 'Feature' ), function () {
	let page: Page;

	setupHooks( ( args ) => {
		page = args.page;
	} );
} );
```

## Test step

Test steps are where most of the action happens in a spec.

> :warning Refer to the [Style Guide](style-guide-playwright.md#test-steps) for do's and don'ts of writing a test step.

Define a test step using the `it` keyword and give it a unique, descriptive name:

```typescript
it( 'Navigate to Media', async function () {
	await SidebarComponent.navigate( 'Media' );
} );
```

`Jest` enforces that test steps within a `describe` block must have unique names.

If a test is to be parametrized, use Jest's built-in [`each`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testeachtablename-fn-timeout):

```typescript
it.each( [ { target: 'Media' }, { target: 'Settings' } ] )(
	'Navigate to $a',
	async function ( { target } ) {
		await SidebarComponent.navigate( target );
	}
);
```

## Hooks

[Hooks](https://jestjs.io/docs/api) are steps run before/after each file or before/after each step in order to perform setup/teardown.

Define hooks as follows:

```typescript
beforeAll( async () => {
	logoImage = await MediaHelper.createTestImage();
} );
```

## Block Smoke Testing

### Overview

The in-depth testing for a given Gutenberg block should be written and executed in the source repo for that block (e.g. Jetpack, Gutenberg, Newspack).  

However, it is often valuable to perform a very basic smoke test on blocks to ensure they function as intended in the WPCOM & Calypso environment.
For consistency and ease of test writing and maintenance, all of this block testing is done in a shared format, where the same basic flow is iterated over all the blocks under test.  

With a few exceptions (like media blocks), block smoke tests should be grouped together according to the _source_ of the block. E.g. all the blocks from Newspack should be in the same spec, all of the core Gutenberg blocks
should be in the same spec, etc. This allows for granular test execution when those sources are updated and the new versions are included in WPCOM.

### How To

1. Create a new class to represent the block flow in the appropriate subdirectory of [calypso-e2e/src/lib/blocks](../../../packages/calypso-e2e/src/lib/blocks).
2. That class should implement the interface `BlockFlow` defined [here](../../../packages/calypso-e2e/src/lib/blocks/schemas.ts).
3. By convention, any test data needed to configure or validate during the block flow should be provided to the class in the constructor.
    - Also by convention, this is usually done in a single object typed locally with an interface called `ConfigurationData`.
4. In the spec file, simply instantiate (with the needed test data) all the block flows you want to include in that spec, and pass that array to `createBlockTests` found in [specs/specs-playwright/shared-specs/block-testing.ts](../specs/specs-playwright/shared-specs/block-testing.ts).

### Examples
<details>
<summary>Block flow class:</summary>

```typescript
import { BlockFlow, EditorContext, PublishedPostContext } from '..';

interface ConfigurationData {
	neededTestString: string;
	neededTestNumber: number;
	// ... type however you want, based on what test data you need!
}

const selectors = {
	// add selectors here
};

export class ExampleBlockFlow implements BlockFlow {
	private configurationData: ConfigurationData;

	constructor( configurationData: ConfigurationData ) {
		this.configurationData = configurationData;
	}

	blockSidebarName = 'Example';
	blockEditorSelector = '[aria-label="Block: Example"]';

	async configure( context: EditorContext ): Promise< void > {
		// use the editor context (things like the editor iframe and Playwrihgt Page) and the configuration data to configure the block in the editor.
	}

	async validateAfterPublish( context: PublishedPostContext ): Promise< void > {
		// use the publsihed post context and the configuration data to do a quick validation of the block content in a published post.
	}
}
```

<summary>Spec test file:</summary>

```typescript
/**

import { ExampleABlockFlow, ExampleBBlockFlow, BlockFlow } from '@automattic/calypso-e2e';
import { createBlockTests } from './shared-specs/block-testing';

const blockFlows: BlockFlow[] = [
	new ExampleABlockFlow( {
		neededString: 'a test data string needed by block Example A'
	} ),
	new ExampleBBlockFlow( {
		neededObj: { 
			// an object of test data needed by block Example B
		}
	} ),
];

createBlockTests( 'Example Blocks', blockFlows );
