## Test Configuration

The tests use the node [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) library to specify config values for the tests.

Under the config directory, there are files for each environment: `default.json` is the base for all environments, then `development.json` for local, and `test.json` for CI.

You can also use local config files that are not committed.

The config files should be added under the `config/` tree and should follow the naming scheme: `local-<env>.json`

The properties in the local configuration override the `default.json` properties. This is useful for local testing of different configurations on local, e.g. testing on local Calypso instance, instead of production, by setting the `calypsoBaseURL` property to `http://calypso.localhost:3000`.

If the configuration doesn't exist, the code falls back to using the environmental variables.

Note: `NODE_CONFIG_ENV` is still required, as it is used to determine what `<env>` config to load.

For example: `export NODE_CONFIG_ENV='personal'`

An example configuration file is provided in the config directory.

The local configurations are excluded from the repository, in order to prevent accidental commit of sensitive data.

**Please don't commit usernames and passwords in these (non local- )files!**
