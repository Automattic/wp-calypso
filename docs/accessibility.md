# Accessibility

This document provides some background on accessibility and how it fits in with our goals for Calypso.

If you're mainly here to learn what to test for as you write or review PRs, we also have an [Accessibility Checklist](accessibility-checklist.md).

## Overview

We need Calypso to be accessible to all our users. According to surveys done by WebAIM,

- 97.6% of screen reader users… [(2014)](http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey5/#javascript)
- 99.5% of users with low vision… [(2013)](http://webaim.org/projects/lowvisionsurvey/#javascript)
- 100% of users with motor disabilities… [(2013)](http://webaim.org/projects/motordisabilitysurvey/#javascript)

… use the internet with JavaScript enabled. These users can use Calypso if we make sure it's accessible and works with assistive technology.

For us, accessible means:

- There are text alternatives for non-text content (videos, images, audio, interactive elements like charts).
- Content can be accessed in different ways, from a computer, phone, or assistive technology, without losing meaning.
- All functionality is available using a keyboard.
- Users have enough time to read and react to content.
- Content is clearly outlined and well-labeled, so that users always know where they are and how to find what they want.
- Content is always localized, and the language of the page and sections are clearly labelled.
- We use labels and accessible notifications to let users know about errors and how to correct them.
- [We don't cause seizures](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#seizure) with animations or flashing notifications.
- We do all this within markup standards and best practices to ensure future compatibility.

— (paraphrased from the [WCAG 2.0 Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/Overview))

For a detailed list of requirements, you can go to [the WCAG 2.0 customized quickref](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&levels=aaa&technologies=smil%2Cpdf%2Cflash%2Csl). There are 3 levels of criteria for each guideline, A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). For Calypso, we aim for WCAG 2.0 Level AA (which also includes level A). This is generally an agreed-upon standard for compliance with equal access laws.

## Automated Testing/Checking

Our ESLint rules include some basic accessibility checks using the [jsx-a11y plugin](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).

## Utilities in Calypso

As we work to make Calypso more accessible, we'll probably add more things here.

* [accessible-focus](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/master/client/lib/accessible-focus/README.md): A small module which is run at client startup and adds an `accessible-focus` class to the document's html element when keyboard navigation is detected, so that obvious focus styles can be added without being distracting for non-keyboard users.
* [Focusable](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/master/client/components/focusable/README.md): A component that lets you wrap complex content in an accessible, clickable wrapper. It adds the "button" ARIA role, for screen reader support, and enables keyboard support for keyboard-only accessibility.
* [ScreenReaderText](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/master/client/components/screen-reader-text): A component that adds text which is invisible on normal displays, but "visible" to screen readers.
