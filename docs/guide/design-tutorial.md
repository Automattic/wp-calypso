## Common elements

### [SectionNav](/devdocs/design/section-nav) (aka ‘Filter Bar’)
Contains the main actions and ‘tabs’ for a section:

[SectionHeader](/devdocs/design/section-header) is essentially the same thing, but without tabs.

### [Headers](/devdocs/design/headers) (aka ‘Header Cake’)
- Essentially it’s a SectionHeader, with centered title and a back button.
- It’s used for navigating between views when you need more space for the UI you want to present.

### [Cards](/devdocs/design/cards) (also, FoldableCard)
Cards are the basic canvases we use to put UI in. They can take many forms. Many components require the base Card component.

### [Notices](/devdocs/design/notice)
- These are temporary messages to alert the user. They can be persistent, but should have an action or a way to close it.
- They appear inline with the rest of the UI.
- [GlobalNotices](/devdocs/design/global-notices) are notices that float/appear on top of the UI, and disappear after a certain amount of time.
- Notices should be used for important and urgent messages. Notices are not to be used for promotions, or anything that is not an alert.

### [Banners](/devdocs/design/banner)
- Often confused with notices, Banners are generic cards that inform users of promotions, help, or information that is not pertinent.

### [EmptyContent](/devdocs/design/empty-content)
- Use when there is no content to show.
- Change the illustration based on the context, and provide a CTA so users don’t feel lost.
