# Information Architecture

Calypso's navigation model is based on two key pieces:

* Masterbar
* Left-to-Right

The Masterbar is the top-level piece of all our UIs across all devices. It's designed to work at desktop size, mobile size, web, iOS, and Android alike.

The Left-to-Right logic means that everything goes from a higher level of abstraction on the left, to a lower level of abstraction on the right, or from step 1 on the left to step N on the right. **Imagine the viewport as a window on a horizontal sheet of paper that moves around based on what needs to be focused**.
 
**Effective Design for Multiple Screens**

The model above is designed to convert well to multiple devices and screens. This is the current Calypso information architecture, mapped to the Masterbar:

And this is how it translates on multiple platforms:

It's exactly the same structure, with the ideal balance between platform standards and the WordPress.com brand.
