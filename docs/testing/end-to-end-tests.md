## What is this?

End-to-end tests (`e2e` for short) describes the automated functional tests that simulate user interaction with the system under test.

A well-maintained suite of e2e tests, in conjunction with CI (continuous integration) pipelines will ensure that regressions to key user flows are caught as early as possible in the development cycle.

## Our Goals

To accelerate development by being a force for continuous improvement, and help identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.

## What is tested?

These end-to-end test focus on several key areas:

- Calypso features.
- interaction between Calypso and Gutenberg editor.
- internationalization and localization.
- Gutenberg blocks added by WordPress.com.
