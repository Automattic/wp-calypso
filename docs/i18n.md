# Internationalization

To make text translatable, youâ€™d use the `translate()` function from [i18n-calypso](../packages/i18n-calypso/README.md). We extract the translatable texts wrapped inside the function and write a POT file that is imported to [translate.wordpress.com](https://translate.wordpress.com/).

Translated texts are [split into chunks loaded via JSON asynchronously](translation-chunks.md).

### String Freeze

If you're launching or updating a feature, and want to make sure that all new strings are translated before merging,
add the label [**[Status] String Freeze**](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/labels/%5BStatus%5D%20String%20Freeze) to your Pull Request.
In the example below, the translation coverage is 79% and the status check fails.

Once the coverage reaches 100%, the status check passes.
