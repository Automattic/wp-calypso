# Internationalization

To make text translatable, youâ€™d use the `translate()` function from [i18n-calypso](../packages/i18n-calypso/README.md). We extract the translatable texts wrapped inside the function and write a POT file that is imported to [translate.wordpress.com](https://translate.wordpress.com/).

Translated texts are [split into chunks loaded via JSON asynchronously](translation-chunks.md).

### String Freeze

If you're launching or updating a feature, and want to make sure that all new strings are translated before merging,
add the label [**[Status] String Freeze**](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/labels/%5BStatus%5D%20String%20Freeze) to your Pull Request.
In the example below, the translation coverage is 79% and the status check fails.

Once the coverage reaches 100%, the status check passes.


### CSS for Multi-Directional Layouts

Use [CSS Logical Properties and Values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) when
building layouts that support both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) languages.
While the following is still supported:
```css
/* LTR-specific code */
.element {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
}
```
Better:
```css
/* Will render correctly in LTR or RTL */
.element {
  position: absolute;
  inset-inline-start: 0; /* inset-inline-start evaluates to left in LTR and right in RTL */
}
```
Similarly, the [text-align](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) property supports additional
values like `start` and `end`. For example, the following is still supported:
```css
/* LTR-specific code */
.is-right-align {
  text-align: right;
}
.is-left-align {
  text-align: left;
}
```
Better:
```css
/* Will render correctly in LTR or RTL */
.is-right-align {
  text-align: end; /* end evaluates to right in LTR and left in RTL */
}
.is-left-align {
  text-align: start; /* start evaluates to left in LTR and right in RTL */
}
```
Detailed information about the supported properties and values can be found at [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/building-multi-directional-layouts/).

#### Caveats

CSS Logical Properties and Values is a [draft standard](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-logical/) (as of August 2022), and
some physical CSS properties, like [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform), have no logical
equivalent. [Discussions](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1544) and [Proposals](https://github.com/w3c/fxtf-drafts/issues/311)
exist to standardize the behaviour, they have stalled.
In such instances, we can rely on the [Webpack RTL Plugin](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/webpack-rtl-plugin)
to transform the content to the correct location on the screen.
