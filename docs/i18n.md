# Internationalization

To make text translatable, youâ€™d use the `translate()` function from [i18n-calypso](../packages/i18n-calypso/README.md). We extract the translatable texts wrapped inside the function and write a POT file that is imported to [translate.wordpress.com](https://translate.wordpress.com/).

Translated texts are [split into chunks loaded via JSON asynchronously](translation-chunks.md).
