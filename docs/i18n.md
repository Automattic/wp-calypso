# Internationalization

If you add or modify text strings that will be displayed to users, consider whether they should be visible to non-English users.
In that case, wrap the strings in the `translate()` function from [i18n-calypso](../packages/i18n-calypso/README.md).
We extract the translatable texts wrapped inside the function and write a POT file that is exported to [translate.wordpress.com](https://translate.wordpress.com/).

Translated texts are [split into chunks loaded via JSON asynchronously](translation-chunks.md).

### String Freeze

If you're launching or updating a feature, and want to make sure that all new strings are translated before merging,
add the label [**[Status] String Freeze**](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/labels/%5BStatus%5D%20String%20Freeze) to your Pull Request.
In the example below, the translation coverage is 79% and the status check fails.

Once the coverage reaches 100%, the status check passes.


### CSS for Multi-Directional Layouts

Use [CSS Logical Properties and Values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) when
building layouts that support both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) languages.
While the following is still supported:
```css
/* LTR-specific code */
.element {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
}
```
Better:
```css
/* Will render correctly in LTR or RTL */
.element {
  position: absolute;
  inset-inline-start: 0; /* inset-inline-start evaluates to left in LTR and right in RTL */
}
```
Similarly, the [text-align](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) property supports additional
values like `start` and `end`. For example, the following is still supported:
```css
/* LTR-specific code */
.is-right-align {
  text-align: right;
}
.is-left-align {
  text-align: left;
}
```
Better:
```css
/* Will render correctly in LTR or RTL */
.is-right-align {
  text-align: end; /* end evaluates to right in LTR and left in RTL */
}
.is-left-align {
  text-align: start; /* start evaluates to left in LTR and right in RTL */
}
```
Detailed information about the supported properties and values can be found at [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/building-multi-directional-layouts/).

#### Caveats

CSS Logical Properties and Values is a [draft standard](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-logical/) (as of August 2022), and
some physical CSS properties, like [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform), have no logical
equivalent. [Discussions](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1544) and [Proposals](https://github.com/w3c/fxtf-drafts/issues/311)
exist to standardize the behaviour, but have stalled.
In such instances, we can rely on the [Webpack RTL Plugin](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/webpack-rtl-plugin)
to transform the content to the correct location on the screen.

### Designing for Internationalization

#### Leave room for text expansion

When text is translated from one language to another,
the length of the text can change. If a text container is too small or has a fixed-sized,
you might end up with truncated or overlapping text. While most users will decipher the meaning
of the text, this isn’t the best user experience.

Some tips:

* **Use flexible design** where possible.
* **Avoid fixed-size containers** for buttons, menus, text boxes, etc.
* **Avoid narrow-width columns**. When longer text wraps, elements in the design may no longer line up.
* **Leave space for both width and height expansion**.
* **Build text containers that do not overlap other containers**.
* **Allow sufficient space in form and input fields**. Putting the form label above the form field allows for the most space.
* **Make sure truncated text doesn't alter meaning in different languages** if you can’t avoid truncating or clipping text. 
  Think of the phrase “Media Assets” being truncated –– the result could be pretty bad…
* **Plan for an average of 40% text expansion.**

#### Images, Graphics, Icons, and Other Media

* Choose images and icons that are applicable across all cultures or adapt the chosen imagery to the locale you are targeting.
* **Select neutral images and icons**.
* **Avoid images with embedded text**. Instead, put the text in the code. Using text-embedded images means having to create a separate image for each locale.
  This increases the amount of work and the number of assets to manage.
* **Be aware of different placement of symbols** in different languages, like currency or percentage signs.
* **Make sure media is localized or localizable**. Embedding a video or linking to a document that is only available in English creates a poor user experience.
 If the asset is only available in English, make that very clear to users or remove it from localized versions.

#### Line Breaking, Sentence Splitting, and Word Wrapping

The general rule of thumb:

* **Keep sentences together**.
* **Wrap words** when possible.
  * Note that [word wrapping rules vary per language](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/typography/linebreak.en).
* **Avoid manual line breaks**, as this might split a sentence into 2 separate strings making it harder to translate.
  * **Use an inline break if you can’t avoid manual line breaks**, so both parts of the sentence are in the same translatable string.
* **Review and test translations in the final design**.

#### Number, Date, and Time Formats

Don't make any assumptions about number, date, and time formats:

* Many regions use a 24-hour clock instead of AM and PM notation.
* Dates are not always displayed Month DD, YYYY. See [Date formats by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country).
* Weeks don’t always start on the same day of the week.
* Different locales use different number separators and decimal marks, i.e., **17,810.25** vs. **17 810,25** vs. **17.810,25**.
