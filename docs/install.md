# Installing Calypso

You can install Calypso directly on your machine by following the next steps, or use a [portable development environment](install.md#using-a-portable-development-environment):

## Quick Summary of Steps

1.	Check that you have all prerequisites (Git, Node, NPM). See [below](install.md#prerequisites) for more details.
2.	Clone this repository locally.
3.	Add `127.0.0.1 calypso.localhost` to your local `hosts` file.
4.	Execute `make run` or `make dashboard` (for a more visually-oriented interface) from the root directory of the repository.
5.	Open [`calypso.localhost:3000`](http://calypso.localhost:3000/) in your browser.

## Prerequisites

**On Mac OS X or Linux**, to be able to clone the repository and run the application you need:

-	Install the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and matching [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) [versions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) listed in the engines section of [package.json](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/package.json). On Mac OS X using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) makes it easy to manage `node` versions.
-	[Git](http://git-scm.com/). Try the `git` command from your terminal, if it's not found then use this [installer](http://git-scm.com/download/).
-	The repository also uses `make` to orchestrate compiling the JavaScript, running the server, and several other tasks. On Mac OS X, the easiest way to install `make` is through Apple's [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) (requires free registration).

**On Windows**, you can follow [these setup steps](windows.md) to install the prerequisites.

## Installing and Running

Clone this git repository to your machine via the terminal using the `git clone` command and then run `make run` from the root Calypso directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso.git
$ cd wp-calypso
$ make run
```

The `make run` command will install any `npm` dependencies and start the development server. When changes are made to either the JavaScript files or the Sass stylesheets, the build process will run automatically. The build process compiles both the JavaScript and CSS to make sure that you have the latest versions of both.

To run Calypso locally, you'll need to add `127.0.0.1 calypso.localhost` to [your hosts file](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/), and load the app at [http://calypso.localhost:3000](http://calypso.localhost:3000) instead of just `localhost`. This is necessary, because when running locally Calypso is using the remote version of the WordPress.com REST API, which allows only certain origins via our current authentication methods.

See [Development Workflow](../docs/development-workflow.md) for more.

## Using a portable development environment

You can install Calypso very quickly via a portable development environment called [Calypso Bootstrap](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso-bootstrap). It uses Vagrant and Puppet behind the scenes to install and configure a virtual machine with Calypso ready to run - with a single command.
