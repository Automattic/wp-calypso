# React Component Unit Testing

Calypso has a lot of React UI components. (Try for example running `find -name *.jsx` under the `client` folder). This combined with the fact that UI tests are among the more difficult things to (unit) test, a guide or checklist for how to make it as easy and focused as possible seems appropriate.

## [Getting started](#getting-started)

To run all current client side tests, run `npm run test-client` in the root source folder. You can also run individual tests. Check [How to run single test runner](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/testing.md) documentation for more details.

Going through the current tests is a good way to get ideas for how different kinds of things can be tested.

### [Set up a test environment](#setting-up-environment)

It's very possible that your tests will assume the existence of a browser environment to work properly. The test runner we use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) allows to set browser-like environment through [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom). We opted to default to node-like environment to make tests faster. If some tests require another environment, you can add a @jest-environment docblock. Check [this Jest doc](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/configuration.html#testenvironment-string) to learn more.

### [What to test?](#what-to-test)

This obviously varies between components, but a few easy things to start out with:
#### Does rendering the component produce expected results
Like its child components?

```javascript
this.posts = shallowRenderer.getRenderOutput();

assert.equal( this.posts.type.displayName, 'Main' );
assert.equal( this.posts.props.children[0].type.displayName, 'SidebarNavigation' );
assert.equal( this.posts.props.children[1].type.displayName, 'PostsNavigation' );
assert.equal( this.posts.props.children[2].type.displayName, 'PostList' );
```

#### Are props passed around correctly
Continuing the example from above

```javascript
// Check that it received the correct class
assert.equal( this.posts.props.className, 'posts' );

// Check that child components that should receive props receive them correctly
assert.equal( this.posts.props.children[1].props.testProp.test, 'test' );
assert.equal( this.posts.props.children[2].props.testProp.test, 'test' );
```

#### The React class's functions
Often there are individually testable functions within React classes. You can access the individual function through the class's prototype.

```javascript
this.Posts.prototype._setWarning(...);
```

#### Is interaction handled correctly
When a user for example clicks an element does the component react like it should?
Example test from `client/components/Accordion`

```javascript
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
import { expect } from 'chai';

it( 'should accept an onToggle function handler to be invoked when toggled', function( done ) {
	const wrapper = shallow( <Accordion title="Section" onToggle={ finishTest }>Content</Accordion> );

	// Simulate a click event to toggle expanding state
	wrapper.find( '.accordion__toggle' ).simulate( 'click' );

	function finishTest( isExpanded ) {
		// Check that it received the toggled state (the component is initially collapsed/not expanded)
		expect( isExpanded ).to.be.true;

		process.nextTick( function() {
			// Check that the component is expanded
			expect( wrapper ).to.have.state( 'isExpanded' ).be.true;
			done();
		} );
	}
} );
```

## [Techniques for avoiding calling other than the targeted code](#techniques-for-avoiding-calling-other-code)
Like their name suggests, unit tests should be targeting only one clear unit at a time. Try to minimize the amount of code you're calling outside the targeted code. This other code could be for example subcomponents, mixins, or just other functions than the one you're testing.

### [Shallow rendering](#shallow-rendering)
Shallow rendering helps with inspecting whether our component renders correctly, without having to render subcomponents. Lets hear it from Facebook themselves:

>Shallow rendering is an experimental feature that lets you render a component "one level deep" and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered. This does not require a DOM.
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering

For a complete example of usage, see `client/components/themes-list/test/index.jsx`.

The render function basically just draws a bunch of Theme subcomponents:
```javascript
...

render: function() {
	return (
		<ul className="themes-list">
			{ this.props.themes.map( function( theme ) {
				return (
					<li key={ 'theme' + theme.name }>
						<Theme theme={ theme } />
					</li>
				);
			} ) }
		</ul>
	);
}

...

```

So we test it like this:

```javascript

this.props = {
	themes: [
		{
			name: 'kubrick',
			screenshot: '/theme/kubrick/screenshot.png',
		},
		{
			name: 'picard',
			screenshot: '/theme/picard/screenshot.png',
		}
	]
};

var shallowRenderer = React.addons.TestUtils.createRenderer();

shallowRenderer.render(
	React.createElement( ThemesList, this.props )
);

this.themesList = shallowRenderer.getRenderOutput();

assert( this.themesList.props.children.length === this.props.themes.length, 'child count is different from themes count' );

```

So here we avoid having to actually draw the `Theme` components when testing `ThemesList`.
