Our Approach to Data
====================

Throughout Calypso's development, our approach to handling data has evolved to allow us to better adapt to the scale at which the application has grown. These shifts have not been ubiquitously adopted throughout the codebase, so you'll occasionally encounter legacy code which is not consistent with our current recommendations. The purpose of this document is to outline a history of these approaches such that you as the developer can understand the differences between each. Furthermore, it seeks to prescribe our current set of recommendations with regard to data management.

## History

There have been three major "eras" of data management throughout the lifetime of Calypso's development. Below, you will find a description of each, common identifying features, and reasons it was adopted in favor of the previous approach.

### First Era: Emitter Objects (June 2014 - April 2015)

Our original approach to managing data took an object-oriented approach, wherein an instance of the store would inherit the [`EventEmitter` interface](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_inheriting_from_eventemitter). Typically, a single instance of each object store was shared across the entire application. The instance was responsible for storing data, but included conveniences to automatically fetch data upon the first request. Used in combination with the [`data-observe` mixin](../client/lib/mixins/data-observe), a developer could monitor an instance of the store passed as a prop to a React component to automatically re-render its contents if the store emitted a `change` event.

__Identifying characteristics:__

- Module directories in `lib`, suffixed with `-list`
- Index file exports a common shared instance of the object prototype
- A `list.js` file includes the store prototype
- The list contains a `get` method which triggers a fetch if no data exists
- Used with the [`data-observe` mixin](../client/lib/mixins/data-observe) in a React component

### Second Era: Facebook Flux (April 2015 - December 2015)

Facebook's [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) is a pattern that encourages a [unidirectional data flow](https://facebook.github.io/flux/img/flux-simple-f8-diagram-explained-1300w.png) in which stores can only be manipulated via actions dispatched by a global dispatcher object. The raw data is never exposed by the store module, and as such, data can only be accessed by using helper ("getter") methods from the exported object. Much like the event emitter object approach, a Flux store module inherits from the [`EventEmitter` interface](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_inheriting_from_eventemitter), though a Flux store should only ever emit a `change` event (this was common but not as strictly enforced in our emitter objects). Stores subscribe to the dispatcher and listen for actions it is concerned with. Action creators are responsible for dispatching these actions. As an example, it is common to have an action creator that triggers a fetch for data - this action creator would dispatch a `FETCH_` prefixed "view" action upon the initial request, then subsequently a `RECEIVE_` prefixed "server" action upon receiving the data. Any store in the application could react to one or both of these action types.

__Identifying characteristics:__

- Module directories in `lib`
- Modules include `actions.js` and at least one store (named or suffixed `store.js`)
- Action creators dispatch view or server actions on the global `Dispatcher` object
- Stores include a top-level object for data storage, which is not directly exported
- Stores export a number of helper getter functions for accessing known data
- Stores subscribe to the Dispatcher, manipulating data in response to action types it is concerned with

__Advantages:__

- Stores can be specialized to their specific needs since dispatched actions are run against all subscribing stores
- There is a single entry point by which data can enter the store. This is easier to manage as an application scales
- Data logic (e.g. fetching) is not intertwined with the storage of the data
- Adopting an accepted pattern grants us access to a community-driven ecosystem of reference implementations

### Third Era: Redux Global State Tree (December 2015 - Present)

[Redux](http://redux.js.org/), described as a "predictable state container", is an evolution of the principles advocated in Flux. It is not a far departure from Flux, but is distinct in many ways:

- There is typically a single store instance which maintains all state for the entire application
- Action creators do not call to the global dispatcher directly, but rather return simple action objects which can be passed to the [store `dispatch` method](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html#dispatch)
- While Flux Stores are responsible for maintaining own state, Redux reducers are composable functions that manipulate specific parts of the global state "tree"
- Since state is the [single source of truth](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html#single-source-of-truth) for the entire application, reducers tend to be much simpler and more transparent than Flux stores

__Identifying characteristics:__

- Files exist within the `state` directory, mirroring the structure of the global tree
- React bindings use [`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) `connect`

__Advantages:__

- An arguably simpler abstraction to the same problems addressed by Facebook’s Flux implementation
- Better suited for server-side rendering, as the singleton nature of Flux stores exposes the risk of leaking session data between requests
- Encourages and often forces a developer toward writing functional, testable code
- Extendable, supporting middlewares to suit our specific needs and [conveniences for use with React](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)

## Current Recommendations

All new data requirements should be implemented as part of the global Redux state tree. The `client/state` directory contains all of the behavior describing the global application state. The folder structure of the `state` directory should directly mirror the sub-trees within the global state tree. Each sub-tree can include their own reducer and actions.

### Terminology

The Redux documentation includes a [detailed glossary of terms](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html). Below is an abbreviated overview of a few of the most common terms:

- Global state (state tree): A deeply nested plain JavaScript object encapsulating the current state of the application, managed by a Redux store instance
- Store instance: An object which manages the current state of the application, both in holding the current state value ([`getState`](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html#getState)), but also as an entry point to introducing new data ([`dispatch`](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html#dispatch))
- Action creators: A function that returns an action
- Actions: An object describing an intended state mutation
- Reducers: A function that, given the current state and an action, returns a new state
- Selectors: A helper function for retrieving data from the state tree. This is not a Redux term, but is a common pattern

### Folder Structure

The root module of the `state` directory exports a single reducer function. We leverage [Redux's `combineReducers` function](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/combineReducers.html) to separate data concerns into their own piece of the overall state. These pieces are reflected by the folder structure of the `state` directory, as shown in the hierarchy below:

```text
client/state/
├── index.js
├── action-types.js
├── selectors/
└── { subject }/
    ├── actions.js
    ├── reducer.js
    ├── schema.js
    └── test/
        ├── actions.js
        └── reducer.js
```

For example, the reducer responsible for maintaining the `state.sites` key within the global state can be found in `client/state/sites/reducer.js`. It's quite common that the subject reducer is itself a combined reducer. Just as it helps to split the global state into subdirectories responsible for their own part of the tree, as a subject grows, you may find that it's easier to maintain pieces as nested subdirectories. This ease of composability is one of Redux's strengths.

### Actions

An action describes an intent to change the state of the application. When an action object is [dispatched](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html#dispatch) to an instance of a Redux store, the reducer function for that store is called with the action. Given the structure of our application state, specific subtrees can maintain their own state in response to any actions for which they are concerned.

An action object should contain a `type` key describing the action. All action types are defined in [`state/action-types.js`](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/client/state/action-types.js). For example, to describe the intent of changing the state to include a few new post objects, you might create an action with the type `POSTS_RECEIVE`. Any other relevant properties can be included in this object if they are needed by the reducer function handler.

As mentioned above, new actions should be added to `action-types.js`. Action types are considered global such that any state subtree's reducer can react to any action types dispatched through the system. The file should remain alphabetized, and we recommend suffixing the verb so that all actions within the same domain scope are in relative proximity. For example, rather than naming your actions `FETCH_POSTS` AND `RECEIVE_POSTS`, you should name them `POSTS_FETCH` AND `POSTS_RECEIVE`.

### Data Normalization

Because a Redux store is the [single source of truth](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html#single-source-of-truth) for the entire application state, it is important that all known data be tracked within the state tree and that it be well-structured. In your reducer functions, consider the data being manipulated in the tree and ensure that subjects are appropriately separated to minimize redundancy and to avoid synchronization concerns. When a subject needs to refer to another part of the tree, store a reference (likely an ID). Tracking an indexed set of items makes it easy to navigate the tree when needing to perform a lookup.

As an example, consider that there are many variations of a "user" in the application. A user may be the current user, a subscriber to a site, or someone who has left a comment on a story in your Reader feed. Each of these display user data in different ways, and in some cases retrieve the data from different sources. However, they can all be classified as a user, and relations between the user and a display context can be established through references.

The following state tree demonstrates how users, sites, and posts may be interrelated, but where data is normalized in a way such that it is always kept in sync, avoiding duplication, and facilitating lookup.

```json
{
	"users": {
		"items": {
			"73705554": {
				"ID": 73705554,
				"login": "testonesite2014"
			}
		}
	},
	"sites": {
		"items": {
			"2916284": {
				"ID": 2916284,
				"name": "WordPress.com Example Blog",
				"description": "Just another WordPress.com weblog",
			}
		},
		"siteUsers": {
			"2916284": {
				"73705554": {
					"roles": [ "administrator" ]
				}
			}
		}
	},
	"posts": {
		"items": {
			"34": {
				"ID": 34,
				"title": "Hello World!",
				"site_ID": 2916284,
				"author_ID": 73705554
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Data Components

First, if you haven't already, you should consider reading the following blog posts, as they help to explain the reasoning behind splitting data and visual concerns:

- [_Container Components_](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005#.zd590uacw)
- [_Presentational and Container Components_](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.cwn6alkqw)

With that in mind, we typically have a few concerns when building a component that has data needs:

- Ensuring that the necessary data is available
- Making the data available to the component
- Allowing the component to modify the data

The first of these, ensuring that data is available, is one that we'd wish to eliminate. It is unfortunate that a developer should concern themselves with the fetching behavior of data, as it would be preferable instead that a component describe its data needs, and that the syncing/fetching behavior be handled behind the scenes automatically. Tools like [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) get us closer to this reality, though Relay has environment requirements that we cannot currently satisfy. For the time being, we must handle our own data fetching, but we should be conscious of a future in which fetching is not a concern for our components.

Framed this way, we can consider two types of data components: app components and query components.

#### App components

An app component wraps a visual component, connecting it to the global application state. We use the [`react-redux` library](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) to assist in creating bindings between React components and the Redux store instance.

Below is an example of an app component. It retrieves an array of posts for a given site and passes the posts to the component for rendering. If you're unfamiliar with the stateless function syntax for declaring components, refer to the [React 0.14 upgrade guide](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html#stateless-functional-components) for more information.

```jsx
function PostsList( { posts } ) {
	return (
		<ul className="posts-list">
			{ posts.map( ( post ) => {
				return <li key={ post.id }>{ post.title }</li>;
			} ) }
		</ul>
	);
}

export default connect( ( state, ownProps ) => {
	return {
		posts: getSitePosts( ownProps.siteId )
	};
} )( PostsList );
```

The `connect` function accepts two arguments, and they each serve a distinct purpose. Both pass props to the app component, and are respectively used to provide data and handle behavior on behalf of the component.

1. `mapStateToProps`: A function which, given the store state, returns props to be passed to the app component. This is used to satisfy the need to make data available to the component.
2. `mapDispatchToProps`: A function which, given the store dispatch method, returns props to be passed to the app component. This is used to satisfy the need to allow the component to update the store state.

As an example, consider a component which renders a Delete button for a given post. We want to display the post title as a label in the delete button, and allow the component to trigger the post deletion when clicked.

```jsx
class PostDeleteButton extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<button onClick={ this.props.delete }>
				{ this.translate( 'Delete %s', { 
					args: [ this.props.label ]
				} ) }
			</button>
		);
	}
}

export default connect(
	( state, ownProps ) => {
		return {
			label: getSitePost( ownProps.siteId, ownProps.postId ).title
		};
	},
	( dispatch, ownProps ) => {
		return {
			delete: () => dispatch( deleteSitePost( ownProps.siteId, ownProps.postId ) )
		};
	}
)( PostDeleteButton );
```

At this point, you might observe that the visual elements rendered in `<PostDeleteButton />` aren't very specific to posts and could probably be reused in different contexts. This is a good observation to make, and in this case it might make sense to split the visual component to its own separate file (e.g. `client/components/delete-button/index.jsx`). You should try to identify these opportunities as often as possible. Since the `connect` wrapping function is detached from the component declaration in the file above, it should not be difficult to separate the two.

Separating visual and data concerns is a good mindset to have when approaching components, and whenever possible, we should strive to create reusable visual components which accept simple props for rendering. However, pragmatically it is unreasonable to assume that components will always be reused and that there's always a clear divide between the visual and data elements. As such, while we recommend creating purely visual components whenever possible, it is also reasonable to create components that are directly tied to the global application state.

#### Query components 

Query components accept as few props as possible to describe the data needs of the context in which they're used. They are responsible for dispatching the actions that fetch the desired data from the WordPress.com REST API. They should neither accept nor render any children.

The benefits of query components are that they (a) are reusable, (b) take advantage of React's lifecycle methods to ensure that data needs are kept in sync, and (c) can be used by app components to maintain their self-sufficiency. That they neither accept nor render children eliminates the need for ancestor components to concern themselves with the data needs of leaf components and [can be more performant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYzlpRvWZ6c&t=1137).

When creating a component that needs to consume data, we can simply include a query component as a child of that component.

Refer to the [`<QueryPosts />` component](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/master/client/components/data/query-posts) as an example of a query component. New query components should be added to the `components/data` directory, prefixed with `query-` such to distinguish them from legacy data components.

### Selectors

A selector is simply a convenience function for retrieving data out of the global state tree. Since the global state tree is a plain JavaScript object, there's nothing to stop you from accessing data directly, but you may find that creating a selector will help to reduce repetition, improve the semantic meaning of your code, and avoid mistakes. For example, the following two approaches both serve to retrieve an array of posts for a specific site, though you might find the selector more convenient and readable at a glance:

```js
// Using a selector
let posts = getSitePosts( state, siteId );

// Navigating the state tree
let posts = state.sites.sitePosts[ siteId ].map( ( postId ) => state.posts.items[ postId ] );
```

You'll note in this example that the entire `state` object is passed to the selector. We've chosen to standardize on always sending the entire state object to any selector as the first parameter. This consistency should alleviate uncertainty in calling selectors, as you can always assume that it'll have a similar argument signature. More importantly, it's not uncommon for selectors to need to traverse different parts of the global state, as in the example above where we pull from both the `sites` and `posts` top-level state keys.

Much like action types, because selectors operate on the entire global state object, we've chosen to place them one-per-file under the `state/selectors` directory. Not only does this reflect their global nature, it removes uncertainty on where selectors are to be found or created by providing a single location for them to exist.

When using selectors, you can import directly from `state/selectors`. For example:

```js
import { canCurrentUser } from 'state/selectors';
```

In this example, the logic for the selector exists at the file `state/selectors/can-current-user.js`. When creating a selector, you must also include its default function export in the list of exports in `state/selectors/index.js`.

It's important that selectors always be pure functions, meaning that the function should always return the same result when passed identical arguments in sequence. There should be no side-effects of calling a selector. For example, in a selector you should never trigger an AJAX request or assign values to variables defined outside the scope of the function.

What are a few common use-cases for selectors?

- Resolving references: A [normalized state tree](#data-normalization) is ideal from the standpoint of minimizing redundancy and synchronization concerns, but is not as developer-friendly to use. Selectors can be helpful in restoring convenient access to useful objects.
- Derived data: A normalized state tree avoids storing duplicated data. However, it can be useful to request a value which is calculated based on state data. For example, it might be valuable to retrieve the hostname for a site, which can be calculated based on its URL property.
- Filtering data: You can use a selector to return a subset of a state tree value. For example, a `getJetpackSites` selector could return an array of all known sites filtered to only those which are Jetpack-enabled. 
 - __Side-note:__ In this case, you could achieve a similar effect with a reducer function aggregating an array of Jetpack site IDs. If you were to take this route, you'd probably want a complementary selector anyways. Caching concerns on selectors can be overcome by using memoization techniques (for example, with a library like [`reselect`](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)).

### UI State

By now, you're hopefully convinced that a global application state can enable us to scale our application needs with regards to persisted data (sites, posts, comments, etc.). The store can also be used to track the state of the user interface, but it's important to distinguish when and why it's appropriate to use the Redux store over, say, a [React component's state](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html#reactive-state).

We recommend that you only use the state tree to store user interface state when you know that the data being stored should be persisted between page views, or when it's to be used by distinct areas of the application on the same page. As an example, consider the currently selected site. When navigating between pages in the [_My Sites_](https://wordpress.com/stats) section, I'd expect that the selected site should not change. Additionally, many parts of the rendered application make use of selected site. For these reasons, it makes sense that the currently selected site be saved in the global state. By contrast, when I navigate to the Sharing page and expand one of the available sharing services, I don't have the same expectation that this interaction be preserved when I later leave and return to the page. In these cases, it might be more appropriate to use React state to track the expanded status of the component, local only to the current rendering context. Use your best judgment when considering whether to add to the global state, but don't feel compelled to avoid React state altogether.

Files related to user-interface state can be found in the [`client/state/ui` directory](../client/state/ui).

### Data Persistence ( [#2754](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/2754) )

Persisting our Redux state to browser storage (localStorage/indexedDB) allows us to avoid completely rebuilding the 
Redux tree from scratch on each page load.

At a high level, implementing this is straightforward. We subscribe to any Redux store changes, and on change we update 
our browser storage with the new state of the Redux tree. On page load, if we detect stored state in browser storage during 
our initial render, we create our Redux store with that persisted initial state.
 
However we quickly run into the following problems:

#### Problem: Subtrees may contain class instances

Subtrees may contain class instances. In some cases this is expected, because certain branches have chosen to use
Immutable.js for performance reasons. However, attempting to serialize class instances will throw errors while saving 
to browser storage.

#### Solution: SERIALIZE and DESERIALIZE actions

To work around this we create two special action types: `SERIALIZE` and `DESERIALIZE`. These actions are not dispatched, 
but are instead used with the reducer directly to prepare state to be serialized to browser storage, and for 
deserializing persisted state to an acceptable initialState for the Redux store.


```javascript
reducer( reduxStore.getState(), { type: 'SERIALIZE' } )
```
and

```javascript
reducer( browserState, { type: 'DESERIALIZE' } )
```

Because browser storage is only capable of storing simple JavaScript objects, the purpose of the `SERIALIZE` action 
type reducer handler is to return a plain object representation. In a subtree that uses Immutable.js it should be 
similar to:
```javascript
export const items = createReducer( defaultState, {
	[THEMES_RECEIVE]: ( state, action ) => // ...
	[SERIALIZE]: state => state.toJS()
} );
```

In turn, when the store instance is initialized with the browser storage copy of state, you can convert 
your subtree state back to its expected format from the `DESERIALIZE` handler. In a subtree that uses Immutable.js 
instead of returning a plain object, we create an Immutable.js instance:
```javascript
export const items = createReducer( defaultState, {
	[THEMES_RECEIVE]: ( state, action ) => // ...
	[DESERIALIZE]: state => fromJS( state )
} );
```
If your reducer state can be serialized by the browser without additional work (eg a plain object, string or boolean), 
the `SERIALIZE` and `DESERIALIZE` handlers are not needed. However, please note that the subtree can still see errors 
from changing data shapes, as described below.

#### Problem: Data shapes change over time ( [#3101](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/3101) )

As time passes, the shape of our data will change very drastically in our Redux store and in each subtree. If we now
persist state, we run into the issue of our persisted data shape no longer matching what the Redux store expects. 

As a developer, this case is extremely easy to hit. If Redux persistence is enabled and we are running master, first 
allow  state to be persisted to the browser and then switch to another branch that contains minor refactors for an 
existing sub-tree. What happens when a selector reaches for a data property that doesn't exist or has been renamed? 
Errors!

A normal user can hit this case too by visiting our website and returning two weeks later.

How can we tell that our persisted data is good to use as initial state?

#### Solution: Schema Validation

Before we can detect data shape changes, we need to be able to describe what our data looks like. To accomplish this, 
we use [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/). JSON Schema is a well-known human and machine readable format that 
defines the structure of JSON data. It is also easily adapted for use with plain JavaScript objects.

A schema file `schema.js` is added at the same level of each reducer. Our schema should aim to describe our data needs,
specifically: what the general shape looks like, which properties must be required, and what additional optional 
properties they might contain. Ideally, we should try to balance readability and strictness.

A simple example schema.js:
```javascript
export const itemsSchema = {
	type: 'object',
	patternProperties: {
		'^\\d+$': {
			type: 'object',
			required: [ 'ID', 'name' ],
			properties: {
				ID: { type: 'number' },
				name: { type: 'string' },
				description: { type: 'string' },
		}
	},
	additionalProperties: false
};
```

A JSON Schema must be provided if the subtree chooses to persist state. If we find that our persisted data doesn't
match our described data shape, we should throw it out and rebuild that section of the tree with our default state.

When using `createReducer` util you can pass a schema as a third param and all that will be handled for you.
```javascript
export const items = createReducer( defaultState, {
	[THEMES_RECEIVE]: ( state, action ) => // ...
}, itemsSchema );
```

If you are not satisfied with the default handling, it is possible to implement your own `SERIALIZE` and
`DESERIALIZE` action handlers in your reducers to customize data persistence. Always use a schema with your custom 
handlers to avoid data shape errors. 

### Opt-in to Persistence ( [#13542](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/13542) )

If we choose not to use `createReducer` we can opt-in to persistence by adding a schema as a property on the reducer. 
We do this by combining all of our reducers using `combineReducers` from `state/utils` at every level of the tree instead 
of [combineReducers](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/combineReducers.html) from `redux`. Each reducer is then wrapped with 
`withSchemaValidation` which returns a wrapped reducer that validates on `DESERIALZE` if a schema is present and 
returns initial state on both `SERIALIZE` and `DESERIALZE` if a schema is not present.

To opt-out of persistence we combine the reducers without any attached schema.
```javascript
return combineReducers( {
    age,
    height,
} );
```

To persist, we add the schema as a property on the reducer:
```javascript
age.schema = ageSchema;
return combineReducers( {
    age,
    height,
} );
```

For a reducer that has custom handlers (needs to perform transforms), we assume the reducer is checking the schema already, 
on `DESERIALIZE` so all we need to do is set a boolean bit on the reducer, to ensure that we don't return initial state
incorrectly from the default handling provided by `withSchemaValidation`.
```javascript
date.hasCustomPersistence = true;
return combineReducers( {
    age,
    height,
    date,
} );
```

### Not persisting data

Some subtrees may choose to never persist data. One such example of this is our online connection state. If connection 
values are persisted we will not be able to reliably tell when the application is offline or online. Please remember
to reason about if items should be persisted.
