This block will be an adaptation of the Atavist Map block, which renders a map using [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/). Editors will be able to control:

- Locations on the map, with optional title and description
- Zoom level
- Style (e.g. Terrain, Satellite)
- Marker color
