/**
 * We have an initiative partnership called Rebrand Cities, where our partners help businesses
 * set up a WordPress.com Business site. The site owners are then encouraged to book a Concierge
 * Session to start chatting directly with our Happiness Engineers. We'd like to flag these sessions
 * as part of the Rebrand Cities program so that the HE has more context and can give the customer
 * a session tailored to the program.
 *
 * The best way to auto-identify a site as belonging to the Rebrand Cities program is by checking
 * if the main Rebrand Cities WordPress.com account is a member of the site â€” this account is used
 * to set up all of these sites.
 *
 * This component's purpose is to check the passed-in siteId and notify using the onChange prop
 * whether the site is a part of the program. This information can then be passed on to the booking
 * API call and used to customize the invitation and inform the HE that this is a Rebrand Cities session.
