						<p>Adding a custom domain is an essential step for your site.</p>

						<p>
							Custom domains are great for SEO, they look more professional, and make it easier to
							share your site on social media, in person, and on business cards.
						</p>

						<p>
							Custom domains are only available on our paid plans, so you’ll need to upgrade if
							you’d like to use <strong>{ domainName }</strong> as your custom domain.
						</p>

						<p>
							Good news is that we’ll pay the domain registration fees for you. Click here to view
							our plan upgrade options.
						</p>

						<p>
							Unlocking access to custom domains is just one of many great reasons to upgrade to a
							paid plan.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h4 className="upsell__section-title">
								Here are three reasons to upgrade to a paid plan:
							</h4>
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>Expert Support.</strong>{ ' ' }

									help via email and live chat any time you have a question.
								</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>No Ads.</strong>{ ' ' }

									allowing you to build a clean site without ads.
								</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>More Storage.</strong>{ ' ' }
								<span>
									Our paid plans offer up to four times more storage. With increased storage space
									you’ll be able to upload more images, audio, and documents to your website. On the
									Premium, Business, and eCommerce plans you can upload videos, too.
								</span>
							</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							And with our popular Premium plan you'll also gain access to some of the most powerful
							features on WordPress.com:

						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>More ways to monetize your site.</strong>{ ' ' }
								<span>
									You can sell stuff on your site without any hassle. Or earn through our special
									advertising program. Or why not both?
								</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Advanced tools to become a social media pro.</strong>{ ' ' }
								<span>
									Schedule posts in advance, resurface your older content, or share multiple social
									posts at a time.
								</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Customize your premium theme to your exact needs.</strong>{ ' ' }
								<span>
									With advanced design features, you can make your site stand out and never be the
									same as others.
								</span>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Our paid plans are the perfect companion for your custom domain. That’s why we’ll
							cover your domain registration for the first year (saving you { domainPrice }), with
							any paid plan.
						</p>

						<p>
							Give our paid plans a risk-free test drive with our{ ' ' }
							<u>30-day Money Back Guarantee.</u>
