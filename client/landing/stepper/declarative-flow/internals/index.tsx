 * 2. It gives every step the ability to navigate back and forth within the flow
 * 3. It's responsive to the dynamic changes in side the flow's hooks (useSteps and useStepsNavigation)
 *
 * @param props
 * @param props.flow the flow you want to render
 * @returns A React router switch will all the routes
