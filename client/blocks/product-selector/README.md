# Product Selector

Product Selector is a React component for rendering a block with products that are available for purchase.

It's used on the plans page near the bundle plans grid and is intended to provide an interface for purchasing specific products.

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ProductSelector from 'blocks/product-selector';

const products = [
	{
		title: 'Jetpack Backup',
		description:
			'Always-on backups ensure you never lose your site. Your changes are saved as you edit and you have unlimited backup archives',
		id: 'jetpack_backup',
		options: {
			yearly: [ 'jetpack_backup_daily', 'jetpack_backup_realtime' ],
			monthly: [ 'jetpack_backup_daily_monthly', 'jetpack_backup_realtime_monthly' ],
		},
		optionsLabel: 'Backup options',
	},
];

const interval = 'yearly';

export default class extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return <ProductSelector products={ products } intervalType={ interval } />;
	}
}
```

## Props

The following props can be passed to the Product Selector block:

- `basePlansPath`: ( string ) Plans page base path.
- `intervalType`: ( string ) Billing interval - `monthly`, `yearly` or `2yearly`.
- `products`: ( array ) Products to render, each with the following structure:

  - `title`: ( string ) Product title.
  - `description`: ( string ) Product description.
  - `id`: ( string ) Product ID.
  - `forceRadios`: ( bool ) Used to force a full display with radio buttons, even when
    there is only option per billing interval and the display would otherwise be simplified.
  - `options`: ( object ) Product options. Each option has the billing interval as a key, and the value is an array with corresponding product slugs. Example:

    ```
    options: {
    	yearly: [ 'jetpack_backup_daily', 'jetpack_backup_realtime' ],
    	monthly: [ 'jetpack_backup_daily_monthly', 'jetpack_backup_realtime_monthly' ],
    }
    ```

  - `optionDescriptions`: ( object ) Optional descriptions for the product options.
    They replace a default `description` in case a given option (represented by the object's key) has been purchased.
    Each key is a product slug, and the value is the corresponding copy. Example:

    ```
    optionDescriptions: {
    	jetpack_backup_daily: translate( 'Looking for more? Get unlimited real-time backup archives' ),
    	jetpack_backup_daily_monthly: translate( 'Looking for more? Get unlimited real-time backup archives' ),
    	jetpack_backup_realtime: translate( 'Your changes are saved as you edit and you have unlimited backup archives' ),
    	jetpack_backup_realtime_monthly: translate( 'Your changes are saved as you edit and you have unlimited backup archives' ),
    }
    ```

  - `optionDisplayNames`: ( object ) Optional display names of the product options.
    They replace a default `title` in case a given option (represented by the object's key) has been purchased.
    Each key is a product slug, and the value is the corresponding title. Example:

    ```
    optionDisplayNames: {
    	jetpack_backup_daily: translate( 'Jetpack Backup Daily' ),
    	jetpack_backup_daily_monthly: translate( 'Jetpack Backup Daily' ),
    	jetpack_backup_realtime: translate( 'Jetpack Backup Real-Time' ),
    	jetpack_backup_realtime_monthly: translate( 'Jetpack Backup Real-Time' ),
    }
    ```

  - `optionShortNames`: ( object ) Optional short names of the product options.
    They are used in the product card options listing, and they are also used in
    the action button (when upgrading), unless overridden by `optionActionButtonNames`.
    Each key is a product slug, and the value is the corresponding title. Example:

    ```
    optionShortNames: {
    	jetpack_backup_daily: translate( 'Daily Backups' ),
    	jetpack_backup_daily_monthly: translate( 'Daily Backups' ),
    	jetpack_backup_realtime: translate( 'Real-Time Backups' ),
    	jetpack_backup_realtime_monthly: translate( 'Real-Time Backups' ),
    }
    ```

  - `optionShortNamesCallback`: ( function ) A callback function which is
    passed the store product object and returns the short name for the product
    option. This is an alternative to `optionShortNames` that can be used when
    the title needs to depend on more than just the product slug.

  - `optionActionButtonNames`: ( object ) Optional names of the product options
    to be used in the action button (when upgrading). Only necessary if you want
    to override the `optionShortNames`/`optionShortNamesCallback` values (which
    are used for the action button by default).

  - `optionsLabel`: ( string ) Title of the product options section.

  - `optionsLabelCallback`: ( function ) A callback function which is passed
    the store product object and returns the title of the product options
    section. This is an alternative to `optionsLabel` that can be used when the
    title needs to be dynamic.

- `productPriceMatrix`: ( object ) Matrix of product price relationships. Each key is a product slug, and each value is an object with the following structure:

  - `relatedProduct`: ( string ) Slug of the related product.
  - `ratio`: ( number ) Ratio between original plan and related plan. Example: for a `yearly` to `monthly` plan, this should be `12`.

  Example:

  ```
  productPriceMatrix: {
  	jetpack_backup_daily: {
  		relatedProduct: jetpack_backup_daily_monthly,
  		ratio: 12,
  	},
  	jetpack_backup_realtime: {
  		relatedProduct: jetpack_backup_realtime_monthly,
  		ratio: 12,
  	},
  }
  ```

- `siteId`: ( number ) ID of the site we're retrieving purchases for. Used to fetch information about the associated purchases of the selected products.
