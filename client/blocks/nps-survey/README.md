NPS Survey
==========

This block is used to display a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to the user.

### Usage

```javascript
	<NpsSurvey
		name="some_screen_v1"
		onClose={ this.handleSurveyClose }
	/>
```

### Props

* `name`: The name of the survey, used in reporting to segment by location survey
	was shown and version of survey. Each distinct location and version combo should
	have a unique name.
* `onClose`: A handler that is fired when the survey has been dismissed. A
	callback function will be passed to the handler that should be called after the survey is hidden.
