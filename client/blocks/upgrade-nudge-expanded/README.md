# Upgrade Nudge Expanded

UpgradeNudgeExpanded displays a huge upgrade nudge, containing PlanCompare card, reasons to upgrade, highlighted feature and benefits of it.

It's meant to comprehensively describe a plan and give enough reasons to upgrade. It uses `plans/constants` information to figure out what features to present and how to direct to checkout.

## Props

- *plan* - PlanSlug of the plan that upgrade leads to. Required. That is the only required prop.
- *event* - event to distinguish the nudge in tracks. Used as `cta_name` event property.
- *title*
- *subtitle*
- *highlightedFeature* - slug of the feature to highlight in the plans compare card
- *benefits* - array of strings explaining the benefits of the feature and upgradidng to the plan
- *upgrade* - upgrade function. If not provided, default will be used.
- *eventName* - event to record when nudge is shown. Default is `calypso_upgrade_nudge_impression` with properties cta_name: props.event, cta_size: expanded and cta_feature: props.highlightedFeature
