# Blocks

Blocks are React components created from UI primitives to generate more complex entities.

They are generally connected to state, and have the ability to dispatch actions. They have application semantics as they represent concepts like "Site", "PostCard", "Comments", etc. Their functionality is encapsulated and allows to easily reuse them in different sections.

Many of these components can be seen in action in our [DevDocs: Blocks](https://wpcalypso.wordpress.com/devdocs/blocks) section.
