# Reader Featured Image

Displays a featured image for a Reader post card.

## Example

The `ReaderFeaturedImage` component can be used in much the same way that you would use an `<ExternalLink>` component. The link wraps whatever is placed between the ReaderFeaturedImage elements.

```html
<ReaderFeaturedImage imageUrl={ imageUrl } href={ href }>[button]</ReaderFeaturedImage>
```

## Props

- `imageUrl`: Image URL
- `href`: The URL to link the featured image to
- `onClick`: Function to execute when image is clicked
