Extension Redirect
==================

`<ExtensionRedirect />` is a React component that conditionally redirects a user from an
extension page to the corresponding plugin installation page, if the corresponding plugin
isn't installed or activated on the given site, or if the required minimum plugin version
isn't met.

## Usage

Render the component, passing `siteId` and `pluginId` (and optionally, `minimumVersion`). It does not accept any children, nor does it render any elements to the page. Use it near the top level of your extension page.

## Props

### `pluginId`

<table>
	<tr><th>Type</th><td>String</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Required</th><td>Yes</td></tr>
</table>

The ID of the plugin for which to check.

### `minimumVersion`

<table>
	<tr><th>Type</th><td>String</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Required</th><td>No</td></tr>
</table>

An optional plugin minimum version to check for.

### `siteId`

<table>
	<tr><th>Type</th><td>Number</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Required</th><td>Yes</td></tr>
</table>

The ID of the site on which to check whether the plugin is installed and activated.
