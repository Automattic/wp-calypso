 * Every selector contained within this directory should have its default
 * export included in the list below. Please keep this list alphabetized for
 * easy scanning.
 *
 * For more information about how we use selectors, refer to the docs:
 *  - https://wpcalypso.wordpress.com/devdocs/docs/our-approach-to-data.md#selectors
 *
 * Studious observers may note that our project is not configured to support
 * "tree shaking", and that importing from this file might unnecessarily bloat
 * the size of bundles. Fear not! For we do not truly import from this file,
 * but instead use a Babel plugin "transform-imports" to transform the import
 * to its individual file.
