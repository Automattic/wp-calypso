 * Determines if the site is old enough that it should have higher free site limits.

 * features of the free plan (for example, 3 GB storage limit down to 0.5 GB).
 * Legacy sites created before that launch should still get the original limits
 * they were created with, though.
 *
 * Note that this does not check if the site is actually a free site *currently*
 * (it might have a paid plan and have even higher limits as a result of that).
