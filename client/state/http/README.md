# HTTP API Layer

[`wpcom-http`](../data-layer/wpcom-http) issues requests to the WordPress.com API. However sometimes you will want to issue a request to another API, maybe even on a third-party host. This raw HTTP layer will allow you to do just that.

It follows the same API as `wpcom-http`, the only difference from the user's perspective being the action dispatched.

## Usage

So, let's say you would like to do a `POST` request to <https://api.example.com> when the action `GET_EXAMPLE_DATA` is dispatched, later continuing with `EXAMPLE_DATA_ADD` for the data or `NOTICE_CREATE` for the error. You'll be able to do that with the following code (that could be located under `third-party`):

```js
import { GET_EXAMPLE_DATA, EXAMPLE_DATA_ADD, NOTICE_CREATE } from 'state/action-types';
import { dispatchRequest } from 'state/wpcom-http/utils';
import { http } from 'state/http/actions';
import { get } from 'lodash';

const requestExampleData = ( action ) =>
	http(
		{
			url: 'https://api.example.com/endpoint',
			method: 'POST',
			headers: [ [ 'Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' ] ],
			body: {
				user_id: 123,
			},
		},
		action
	);

const receivedExampleData = ( action, data ) => ( {
	type: EXAMPLE_DATA_ADD,
	data,
} );

const receivedExampleDataError = ( action, error ) => ( {
	type: NOTICE_CREATE,
	notice: {
		text: get( error, 'response.body.error', null ),
	},
} );

export default {
	[ GET_EXAMPLE_DATA ]: dispatchRequest( {
		fetch: requestExampleData,
		onSuccess: receivedExampleData,
		onError: receivedExampleDataError,
	} ),
};
```

For requests parameters see [`state/http/actions.js`](./actions.js).
