Directly data-layer
===================

[Directly's](https://www.directly.com/) Real Time Messaging (RTM) widget is an on-demand
customer support tool. Read more about the RTM widget and how it's used in Calypso in the
[`lib/directly` README](../../../../lib/directly/README.md).

This data-layer integration executes the imperative RTM API commands when
corresponding Redux actions are intercepted.
