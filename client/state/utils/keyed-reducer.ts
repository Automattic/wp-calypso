/**
 * Creates a super-reducer as a map of reducers over keyed objects
 *
 * Use this when wanting to write reducers that operate
 * on a single object as if it lived in isolation when
 * really it lives in a map of similar objects referenced
 * by some predesignated key or id. This could be used
 * for example when reducing properties on a site object
 * wherein we have many sites keyed by site id.
 *
 * Note! This will only apply the supplied reducer to
 * the item referenced by the supplied key in the action.
 *
 * If no key exists whose name matches the given lodash style keyPath
 * then this super-reducer will abort and return the
 * previous state.
 *
 * The keyed reducer implements the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods and makes sure
 * that Calypso state persistence works as expected (ignoring empty and initial state,
 * serialization into multiple storage keys etc.)
 * @example
 * const age = ( state = 0, action ) =>
 *     GROW === action.type
 *         ? state + 1
 *         : state
 *
 * const title = ( state = 'grunt', action ) =>
 *     PROMOTION === action.type
 *         ? action.title
 *         : state
 *
 * const userReducer = combineReducers( {
 *     age,
 *     title,
 * } )
 *
 * export default keyedReducer( 'username', userReducer )
 *
 * dispatch( { type: GROW, username: 'hunter02' } )
 *
 * state.users === {
 *     hunter02: {
 *         age: 1,
 *         title: 'grunt',
 *     }
 * }
 * @param {string} keyPath lodash-style path to the key in action referencing item in state map
 * @param {Function} reducer applied to referenced item in state map
 * @returns {Function} super-reducer applying reducer over map of keyed items
