These files are borrowed from Rewind, pending the work needed to release them as a public npm
package. They help Calypso interpret the credentials APIâ€™s step-by-step progress streams, with a
state machine that maps the progress messages (or state transitions) to a list of steps that can
more easily be rendered by the UI.

When this directory is removed, remember to update /.eslintignore and /.prettierignore!
