## Actions

Used in combination with the Redux store instance `dispatch` function, actions can be used in manipulating the current global state.

  ### `initConnection()`

Opens Happychat Socket.IO client connection. _Note: Most use cases should use the Query Component
[`<HappychatConnection />`](../../components/happychat/connection.jsx) instead of dispatching
this action directly._

### `setCurrentMessage( message: String )`

Updates the pending message that the user is composing in the Happychat client.

### `sendMessage( message: String )`

Sends the message as a chat message to the Happychat service.
