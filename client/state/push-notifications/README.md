# Push Notifications

A module for managing push notification state & communicating with the service worker.

## Selected selectors

### `getStatus` (string)

- `denied`: The user denied the push notification via the browser's UI. Further calls to the `activateSubscription` action will fail. The user must grant permission manually via the browser's UI. We cannot trigger that UI.
- `subscribed`: The user has opted into push notifications via a call to `subscribe()`.
- `enabling`: The user has clicked enable and we don't yet have a subscription.
- `disabling`: The user has clicked disable and we are disabling our subscription.
- `unsubscribed`: The user has either not yet given permissions, or has revoked them via a call to `unsubscribe()`
- `unknown`: The browser may not support push notifications, or the state has not yet been determined

## Selected Action creators

- `toggleEnabled`: Turn push notifications on and off

### How to use

```js
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

function mapStateToProps( state ) {
	return {
		getStatus: getStatus( state ),
		isBlocked: isBlocked( state ),
		isEnabled: isEnabled( state ),
		isNoticeDismissed: isNoticeDismissed( state ),
		// etc.
	};
}
const mapDispatchToProps = {
	toggleEnabled,
};

class YourReactClass extends React.Component {
	toggleEnabled = () => {
		this.props.toggleEnabled();
	};
}

export default connect( mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps )( YourReactClass );
```
