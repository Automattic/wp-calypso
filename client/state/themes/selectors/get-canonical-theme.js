/**
 * knownConflictingThemes: A list of themeIds which we prefer to fetch from the
 * jetpack/atomic site over the wpcom/wporg galleries.
 *
 * In most cases, we want to prefer the theme information found on wpcom or
 * wporg over the information found on a user's jetpack or atomic site, because
 * the info on wpcom or wporg has a longer description, more screenshots, and
 * more fields.
 *
 * However, some themes have a conflicting themeId. For example, let's say I
 * buy the bistro theme off woocommerce.com and install it on my jetpack or
 * atomic site. When I search for information about 'bistro' in the WPCOM ->
 * WPORG -> JP/Atomic order, I will first find information in
 * https://wp-themes.com/bistro/, which is a completely different theme than
 * the one offered on woocommerce.
 *
 * One solution would be to always prefer what's found on a user's
 * jetpack/atomic site over the centralized galleries. However, that results in
 * a notably degraded experience when looking at the theme info for popular
 * bundled themes like twentytwentyone.
 *
 * So it seems somewhat hacky, but keeping a list of themes where we prefer the
 * jetpack/atomic versions is a straightforward way to solve the bistro conflict while
 * keeping the rich theme information for twentytwentyone.
