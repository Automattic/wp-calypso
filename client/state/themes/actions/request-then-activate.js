/**
 * requestThenActivate: Like activate(), which triggers a network request to
 * activate a specific theme on a given site, but it calls requestTheme() to
 * get that theme's information first.
 *
 * This allows Calypso to know if the theme is an autoloading homepage theme,
 * which changes the activation behavior (these themes display a modal to the
 * user before activating).
 * Generally it's not needed if you're already on the theme showcase, but if you're
 * somewhere else on the site, the data might not be available.
 *
 * @param  {string}   themeId   Theme ID
 * @param  {number}   siteId    Site ID
 * @param  {string}   source    The source that is requesting theme activation, e.g. 'showcase'
 * @param  {boolean}  purchased Whether the theme has been purchased prior to activation
 * @param  {boolean}  keepCurrentHomepage Prevent theme from switching homepage content if this is what it'd normally do when activated
 * @returns {Function}          Action thunk

		// thank you page), that means we'd have to requestThemes() on both
