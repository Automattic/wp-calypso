# Jetpack Manage Error Pages

This component is used to catch Jetpack management errors at a high level,
and render an appropriate error page before any management tools are rendered.

This component is an extension of the [EmptyContent component][1], and it accepts
the same properties.

Additionally, this component accepts a `template` property which will render some pre-defined
templates. Here are acceptable values for `template` along with examples of how to use them.

## updateJetpack

To display a page that will prompt the user to update Jetpack.
You'll need to declare `site` which is simply the current site object.
You can optionally declare `version` to display what version is necessary (defaults to 3.4).

```jsx
import JetpackManageErrorPage from 'my-sites/jetpack-manage-error-page';

<JetpackManageErrorPage template="updateJetpack" siteId={ jetpackSiteId } version="3.4" />;
```

## default

As stated above, this component renders an `emptyContent` component by default. For example:

## Feature Example

If you initialize the component with a property `featureExample` containing jsx, it will be added in the bottom of the Jetpack Manage Error Page as an example of what the user could be viewing if there weren't any access errors.

```jsx
import JetpackManageErrorPage from 'my-sites/jetpack-manage-error-page';

// create the component using properties accepted by EmptyContent
<JetpackManageErrorPage
	action={ this.props.translate( 'Manage general settings' ) }
	actionURL="../../settings/general/"
	title={ this.props.translate( 'No security configuration is required.' ) }
	line={ this.props.translate( 'Security management is automatic for WordPress.com sites.' ) }
	illustration="/calypso/images/illustrations/illustration-jetpack.svg"
/>;
```
