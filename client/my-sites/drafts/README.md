Drafts
======

Powers the drafts panel in the editor and `/drafts`, which is not yet enabled in production environments. (Note: `/posts/drafts` is handled in `client/my-sites/posts`.]

Contains both the section routes for `/draft`, the controller, the main view for the sections, and a list component that we reuse in the editor.
