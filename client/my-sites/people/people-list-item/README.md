PeopleListItem
==============

This component is used to render items within the ViewersList, the TeamList, the FollowersList, and PeopleInvites.
It will display a person's avatar, a small stack of information about the user, as well as an action button for followers, viewers, and invites. TeamList does not require an action button.
