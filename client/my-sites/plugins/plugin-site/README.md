Plugin Site
===========

This component is used to represent the state of a single instance of a plugin in a site. Internally, it follows a factory pattern, returning one instance of `plugin-site-network` or `plugin-site-jetpack` depending on the properties of the site received.

#### How to use:

```js
var PluginSite = require( 'my-sites/plugins/plugin-site/plugin-site' );

render: function() {
    return <PluginSite
            site={ site }
            secondarySites={ this.getSecondaryPluginSites( site ) }
            plugin={ this.state.plugin }
            wporg={ this.state.plugin.wporg }
            notices={ this.state.notices } />;
}
```

#### Props

* `site`: a site object with the site which would be associated to the component.
* `secondarySites`: if `site` is a network site, secondarySites should contain an array with the lists secondary sites of the network.
* `plugin`: a plugin data object.
* `notices`: a notices object
* `wporg`: (boolean) whether the plugin is from the .org repository or not
