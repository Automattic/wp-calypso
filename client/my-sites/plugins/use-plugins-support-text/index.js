 * If pro plan is active and site is eligible:

 *
 * If pro plan is inactive/ineligible, and their current plan has the Live Support feature:
 *    "Live chat support 24x7".
 *
 * If pro plan is inactive/ineligible, they have "Annually" selected in the top right,
 * meaning they intend to buy an annual plan:
 *    "Live chat support 24x7".
 *
 * If pro plan is inactive/ineligible, and their current plan does not have the Live
 * Support feature, and they have "monthly" selected in the top right, meaning

 *   "Unlimited Email Support".
 *
 * We don't know exactly what plan they're going to buy, so we make an assumption that
