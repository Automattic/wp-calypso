# Marketing

The components within this directory are used to enable a user to manage their marketing settings.

## Connections

The Connections components allow a user to add, edit, and remove third-party service providers to their account and/or sites. Historically, this has been primarily focused on the publicize action. Moving forward, we have plans to enable other actions and integrations. For example, we could potentially support integration with Dropbox and allow a user to insert images from their Dropbox directory.

## Sharing Buttons

The Sharing Buttons components enable a user to control the appearance and placement of sharing buttons on their sites. Appearance options include button style, share text, and enabled sharing providers. Placement options allow control over the posts for which likes, reblogs, and sharing buttons are shown, and whether links should open in a new or same window.
