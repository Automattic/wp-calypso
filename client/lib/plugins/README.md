# Plugins

Plugins uses a [flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#content) approach to managing plugins data in calypso.

**Note: usage of the plugins store is discouraged, please use the Redux version instead**

## Plugins Store

The Plugins Store is responsible for keeping each site's plugin list up to date. Initially it loads the data and request it as it gets updated. This store also listens to any actions relevant to keep the data up to date such as the plugin update/activate/deactivate etc.

### The Data

The Data that is stored in the sites plugin store looks like this:

```js
const object = {
	123456: {
		// site.ID
		akismet: {
			// plugin.slug
			active: true,
			author: 'Automattic',
			author_url: 'http://automattic.com/wordpress-plugins/',
			autoupdate: false,
			description:
				'Used by millions, Akismet is quite possibly the best way in the world to <strong>protect your blog from comment and trackback spam</strong>. It keeps your site protected from spam even while you sleep. To get started: 1) Click the "Activate" link to the left of this description, 2) <a href="http://akismet.com/get/">Sign up for an Akismet API key</a>, and 3) Go to your Akismet configuration page, and save your API key.',
			id: 'akismet/akismet',
			name: 'Akismet',
			network: false,
			plugin_url: 'http://akismet.com/',
			slug: 'akismet',
			version: '3.1.1',
			update: {
				id: '1232',
				new_version: '3.1.2',
				package: 'https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/akismet.1.6.zip',
				plugin: 'akismet/akismet',
				slug: 'akismet',
				url: 'https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/',
			},
			selected: true,
		}, //, etc.
	}, //, etc.
};
```

The Data is stored in a private variable but can be accessed though the stores public methods.
