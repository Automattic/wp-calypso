WPORG Data
=======


### Store
The WPorg Store is responsible for storing the state of plugins from .org so that we don't have to fetch them each time.

####The Data
The data that is stored in the store looks like this:

```js
{
	akismet : { // plugin.slug
		author: "Automattic",
		author_url: "http://automattic.com/wordpress-plugins/",
		banners: undefined,
		description: "Akismet checks your comments against the Akismet Web service to see if they look like spam or not.",
