# local-storage-polyfill

This is a very simple polyfill that implements the core methods of localStorage when the native API is either unavailable or not working correctly (e.g., safari in private mode).

```js
localStorage.setItem( key, value );
localStorage.getItem( key );
localStorage.removeItem( key );
localStorage.clear();
localStorage.length;
```

Just require and call this once into the page (prior to any calls to these methods) and it will either create or augment the `window.localStorage` object as necessary.

```js
import localStorePolyfill from 'lib/local-storage-polyfill';
```
