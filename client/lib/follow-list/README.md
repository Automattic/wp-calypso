FollowList
===========
If you have components that utlize 'Follow' actions for users, the follow-list acts as a central store for all site/follow data.  So if a user clicks follow within one component, all other associated follow buttons can be updated by an emitted change event.

```js
import FollowList from 'follow-list';
var follow-list = FollowList();
```

### add( { site_id: site.ID, is_following: true } )
If the `site_id` being passed in does not yet exist in the array of `follow-list` data, a new `FollowListSite` object is created and added to the array.  The method returns the instance of the `FollowListSite` so you can use that object to subscribe to change events:

```js
var newFollowListSite = follow-list.add( { site_id: 1, is_following: false } );

// then in a jsx component

mixins: [ observe( 'newFollowListSite' ) ]

```

FollowListSite
==============
Instances of `FollowListSite` are created using the steps outlined above.

### follow()
If the `is_following === false` this method will call the api to start following the site.  Once the api operation complets, a change event is fired.

### unfollow()
If the `is_following === true` this method will call the api to stop following the site.  Once the api operation complets, a change event is fired.

Module Dependencies
===================

# External Dependencies
* `EventEmitter` to send `change` events which are subscribed to via the `mixins\data-observe` within your jsx component.

# Internal Dependencies
* `wp` for api operations

# Tests
Execute `make` from the root of the directory
