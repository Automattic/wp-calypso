Payment Gateway Loader
======================

Payment gateways often provide JS libraries used to securely generate tokens from credit card details.
For example, `Paygate` is a library by WordPress.com we can use to send Credit card data to the Paygate server and recieve back a token which we then submit to MoneyPress.

This class, `PaymentGatewayLoader`, takes care of the details of loading the remote payment gateway JS script (i.e. `paygate.js`) asynchronously.
You can access the `Paygate` class from within the callback of `PaygateLoader.ready` like so:


```es6
var paymentGatewayLoader = require( 'lib/payment-gateway-loader' );

function onSuccess( token ) {
	// Do something with the Paygate token
}

function onError( error ) {
	// Uhoh! We couldn't get a token for some reason
}

paymentGatewayLoader.ready( url, 'Paygate', function( Paygate ) {
	var card = {
		'name': 'WordPress User',
		'number': '4111111111111111',
		'cvc': '111',
		'exp_month': '02',
		'exp_year': '2017',
	};

	Paygate.create_token( card, onSuccess, onError );
} );
```
