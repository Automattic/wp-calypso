# Track User Resurrections

`<TrackResurrections />` is a React component used to help track when a user has been resurrected.
A resurrected user is a user who hasn't visited the admin end of a site for more than a year.


## Usage

Render the component like this.

```jsx
<ContainerComponent>
	<TrackResurrections />
</ContainerComponent>;
```

It does not accept any children, nor does it render any elements to the page.
