# Reader Follow Button

A specialization of the generic `components/follow-button` that sends stats.

## Props

- `location`: the MC stats key for the current page, e.g. following_edit
- `isButtonOnly`: if true, use the FollowButton component rather than FollowButtonContainer
- `railcar`: Train Tracks Railcar string for stats (optional)

See `components/follow-button` for other props this component accepts.
