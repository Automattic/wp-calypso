# ReaderPopover

This is a wrapper around Popover used in Reader. It behaves identically to Popover, but has a slightly different look and feel and adds an optional title. To avoid style duplication, it's wrapped up in this component.

## Usage

See components/popover/README.md.

## Additional props

### `popoverTitle`

Optional. Shown as a title in the header of the popover.
