Reader
======

The Reader module handles the view and routing logic for the *Reader* section of Calypso.

The 'following' view is the default view in Calypso, served at `/`. These routes are also served by the module:

- /read/*
- /following/*
- /fresh
- /recommendations
- /activities/comments and /activities/likes
