# Styles

Calypso uses Sass to build its CSS. Remember that all styles, even when loaded at different times, eventually end up on one page as part of a single HTML document. Make sure you namespace your styles for the page you are working on.

This directory contains styling that is applied globally, such as resets and animations. You shouldn't typically need to add a new Sass file to this directory if you just want to style a newly added component.

Check [our styleguide](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/css.md) for more information on how we use Sass.
