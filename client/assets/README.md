Assets
======

This directory should include shared assets that will be imported by components.

For example:

```jsx
// Image is located at client/assets/images/cat-meme.gif
import iCanHasCheezburger from 'assets/images/cat-meme.gif';

function MyCatGif() {
	return <img alt="I CAN HAS CHEEZBURGER?" src={ iCanHasCheezburger } />;
}
```
