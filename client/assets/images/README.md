# Images

Images from this folder are managed by Webpack, and can be imported like this:

```javascript
import mediaPostImage from 'assets/images/upgrades/media-post.svg';
```
Note this creates an immutable name with a hash suffix for the image asset: the url  will change if the source image changes.
