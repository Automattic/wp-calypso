# WooCommerce for Calypso

Sell anything, beautifully. Now from Calypso.

## Prerequisites

WooCommerce for Calypso requires a few plugins to be in place on your WordPress.org installation in order to work properly:

- [Jetpack](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack) - powers the API behind Calypso.
- [WooCommerce](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce) - at least 3.1 (use `master` for now).
- [WooCommerce API Dev](https://github.com/woocommerce/wc-api-dev) - a feature plugin that augments the core WooCommerce REST API. (with development moving at a more rapid pace - keep this one up to date!)
- [WooCommerce Services](https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-services/) - powers USPS shipping in Calypso.

Ensure that all plugins are installed and activated. Jetpack should be connected to WordPress.com, and WooCommerce Services should be connected to Jetpack.
