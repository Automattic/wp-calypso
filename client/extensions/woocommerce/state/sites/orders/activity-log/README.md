Activity Log
===========

This module is used to manage the events that should be displayed in the Activity Log section of an Order page.

This will include order notes, and if the WooCommerce Services extension is enabled, shipping label events.

This module doesn't have reducers or actions. Since the only thing it does is aggregate data from other modules, it just has selectors.
