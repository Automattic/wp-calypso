# State

This directory contains all of the behavior describing the application state for the woocommerce extension. This is a sub-tree of the global state, stored in `state.extensions.woocommerce`.

## Structure

### [`ui`](ui/README.md)

Tracks all UI state. Currently this includes "edit states" of API data.

### [`sites`](sites/README.md)

Handles data fetched from the remote site's API
