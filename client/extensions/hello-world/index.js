				<p>This section is the home for the <strong>Hello World</strong> extension.</p>
				<p>Extensions are setup to function in a semi-isolated environment, with their own url path and code chunk magic (using the power of Webpack) to assure code is loaded only when needed. Think of extensions as individual "apps" you can access in Calypso to interact with your plugin functionality in a focused way.</p>
