# Tutorial: Building a Simple Tour

In this tutorial, we'll create a brief tour that shows a user how "View Site" works.

It's not a comprehensive tutorial, but walks you through many of the different tasks that you'll encounter when developing a tour using Guided Tours.

For more complete technical information, please see the existing tours (linked to [in the README.md](../README.md)), [the examples](./examples/README.md), the [API documentation](./API.md), and the [architecture documentation](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

**PLEASE NOTE:** This tour is merely an example. It is not a real tour that we're showing to users. The step sequence and copy especially didn't go through multiple iterations like we'd normally do with a new tour.

## What Do We Want To Achieve?

Before we think about what steps we want our tour to have, we should take a step back and think about **what goals we want to achieve** with our tour.

In this case, we might want to make sure new users understand where the site preview is and how it works.

In addition, we should think about how to **measure reaching this goal**. Here, we would hope that with our tour active, we would soon see an increase the usage of the site preview by new users.

Note: we've found it helpful for a developer and a designer (and possibly other roles, depending on your goals) to team up.

## Decide for Tour Steps

With that in mind, we can come up with this first draft for a set of steps:

1. Ask the user whether they want to learn how to preview their site.
2. Point to the site preview and tell the user to click their site's title so that the preview opens.
3. When the preview is showing, explain that this is the site preview.
4. Finish the tour.

We could have included a step — or even multiple steps — to explain the different device sizes or the SEO upgrade. But it's advisable to start off with tours that are as short as possible to see how they perform. We can always come back and add additional steps.

And in that spirit, we can iterate over the steps once more to reduce them. We don't **really** need steps to ask whether a user wants to take the tour or not, and we don't **really** need a finishing step. We could also finish the tour with the preview still open so the user can explore it without a tour step showing.

With these thoughts, we can come up with these steps:

1. Point to "View Site" and tell the user to click their site's title to learn about it. Provide a "Quit" button though so it's obvious what to do if they don't want to take the tour.
2. Explain the preview, and finish the tour with it staying open.

And with that, we can now think about what will trigger our tour.

## Decide for Triggers

To start the tour, we need to provide a list of paths and a trigger function.

We want our tour to start when the user is looking at their stats. We therefore use `[ '/stats' ]` as the path. Note that in the tour implementation, we can provide a single path as just a string as opposed to an array.

We only want our tour to show for users who have registered in the past 7 days. We express that by giving the `Tour` element an appropriate `when` attribute. We also only want to show it if the current site can indeed be viewed using "View Site".

## Write the Tour

Now we're ready to actually start writing our tour.

<!--eslint ignore no-heading-punctuation-->

### Scaffolding, etc.

First we'll need to create a directory tour, under `tours`. In there, we create two files: `meta.js` and `index.js`.
`meta.js` contains the metadata for a tour. Here's an empty boilerplate:

```javascript
/**
 * Internal dependencies
 */
import { and } from 'layout/guided-tours/utils';

export default {};
```

For `index.js`, this is the essential boilerplate, which comprises the imports and the `makeTour` wrapping:

```javascript
/**
 * External dependencies
 */
import React from 'react';

/**
 * Internal dependencies
 */
import meta from './meta';
import {
	makeTour,
	Tour,
	Step,
	ButtonRow,
	Quit,
	Continue,
} from 'layout/guided-tours/config-elements';
import { isNewUser, isEnabled, isSelectedSitePreviewable } from 'state/guided-tours/contexts';

export const TutorialSitePreviewTour = makeTour();
```

Now add that tour to the [config list](../config.js):

```diff
 …
 import { SiteTitleTour } from 'layout/guided-tours/tours/site-title-tour';
+import { TutorialSitePreviewTourMeta } from 'layout/guided-tours/tours/tutorial-site-preview-tour/meta';

 export default {
		 …
		 siteTitle: SiteTitleTour,
+    tutorialSitePreview: TutorialSitePreviewTourMeta,
```

And to the [tour list](../all-tours.js):

```diff
 …
 import { SiteTitleTour } from 'layout/guided-tours/tours/site-title-tour';
+import { TutorialSitePreviewTour } from 'layout/guided-tours/tours/tutorial-site-preview-tour';

 export default combineTours( {
		 …
		 siteTitle: SiteTitleTour,
+    tutorialSitePreview: TutorialSitePreviewTour,
```

And add a [feature flag](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/HEAD/config/development.json) for the appropriate environment(s), such as `"guided-tours/tutorial-site-preview": true,`.

**Important:** use the feature flag to ensure that the tour is only triggered in environments where all the required features are available. E.g. especially the `desktop` environment may differ from general Calypso because of the different context that it runs in and the different release cycles.

### The Tour element

Now we need to configure the metadata for the tour. In `meta.js`:

```javascript
export default {
	name: 'sitePreview',
	version: '20170104',
	path: '/stats',
	when: and( isEnabled( 'guided-tours/main' ), isSelectedSitePreviewable, isNewUser ),
};
```

- `name` is the tour's name. It must match the key used in [config.js](../config.js), as we use it to refer to the tour inside the Guided Tours system (`combineTours`) and to force the tour to start via the query arg (`?tour=<TOURNAME>`).
- `version` is the tour's version. The value is yours to choose, though we usually use the date we created the tour in YYYYMMDD format.
- `path` is the path part of the URL that we want to trigger the tour on. Can also be an array.
- `when` is a boolean function that the framework tests to see whether the tour should be triggered or not. The first check should be checking whether the feature flag for this tour is enabled.
- `isSelectedSitePreviewable` guards us against showing this step if the current site cannot be previewed.

We can now use this data in the tour visual component. In `index.js`:

```JSX
export const TutorialSitePreviewTour = makeTour(
  <Tour { ...meta } >
    <!-- this is where the tour steps go ... -->
  </Tour>
);
```

### Add an A/B Test

To assess the impact of a tour, it can be helpful to run it as an A/B test. If the user is in the test group we trigger the tour. If they're in the control group we don't trigger the tour. After you've collected some data, you'll hopefully be able to gauge the impact that the tour has on the metric(s) you're interested in.

Open up `client/lib/abtest/active-tests.js` and add a new test such as this one:

```javascript
export default {
	designShowcaseWelcomeTour: {
		datestamp: '20170101',
		variations: {
			enabled: 0,
			disabled: 100,
		},
		defaultVariation: 'disabled',
		allowExistingUsers: true,
	},
};
```

Note that we've set the `enabled` variation to 0% so we don't show the tour to any user until we've tested it thoroughly.

Now we need to make sure the tour only triggers if the user in the `enabled` variant.

First, add an import for `isAbTestInVariant` to the list of things we import from `state/guided-tours/contexts` in `meta.js`.

Now, use the import in the `when` property like so:

```javascript
export default {
	when: and(
		isNewUser,
		isEnabled( 'guided-tours/main' ),
		isAbTestInVariant( 'tutorialSitePreviewTour', 'enabled' )
	),
};
```

**Important:** note that we want to put the call to `isAbTestInVariant` last — it puts users into an A/B test variant, and having later parts of the function return false would taint our results. We want to assign the user to an A/B test variant if and only if the tour would have triggered based on all the other conditions.

## Adding the First Step

Now let's insert the first `<Step>` element into the `<Tour>`. It looks like this:

```JSX
<Step
	name="init"
	target="sitePreview"
	arrow="top-left"
	placement="below"
	scrollContainer=".sidebar__region"
>
	{ ( { translate } ) => (
		<Fragment>
			<p>
				{ translate(
					'{{strong}}View Site{{/strong}} shows you what your site looks like to visitors. Click it to continue.',
					{ components: { strong: <strong /> } },
				) }
			</p>
			<Continue hidden click step="finish" target="sitePreview" />
			<ButtonRow>
					<Quit subtle>{ translate( 'No, thanks.' ) }</Quit>
			</ButtonRow>
		</Fragment>
	) }
</Step>
```

A few notes:

- the `children` of the `Step` component is not a regular JSX markup. It's a so-called render prop: a component (function or class) to be rendered. The component will be passed the `translate` function as a prop. The reason for this design is performance: we don't need to instantiate all the JSX markup and translate all strings for all steps for all tours statically when loading the modules: they are hidden inside a component and evaluated only when a particular step is actually rendered.
- The first step of a tour needs to have a name of `init` to be recognizable as the first step by the framework.
- The `target` is the DOM element the step should be "glued" to or will point at. There are two ways to do that: either the element has a `data-tip-target` attribute, and we pass that name, or we pass a CSS selector that selects that element (cf. method `targetForSlug`). In this case, it's a `data-tip-target`.
- The `scrollContainer` tells the framework which container it should attempt to scroll in case the `target` isn't visible. In this case, the framework will attempt to scroll the sidebar until the site preview button is in view.
- `translate` calls: we'd add those only after multiple iterations over the copy. Once you merge something with a `translate` call into `master`, the strings will be translated -- and we don't want to waste anyone's time with translating strings that will still change a few times.
- The `Continue` steps attributes basically say: when the user `click`s the `target`, proceed to the step called `close-preview` (the next step, below). The `hidden` attribute tells the framework to not add an explanatory text below the step.
- The `ButtonRow` with the `Quit` button doesn't really look nice, but it's important to provide a way for the user to get out of the tour. The framework will quit a tour if it believes that the user is trying to navigate away from it, but in this case we thought an explicit way to quit would be good to provide.

## Adding the Second Step

Now we add the second step after the first one:

```JSX
<Step name="finish" placement="center">
	{ ( { translate } ) => (
		<Fragment>
			<p>
				{ translate(
					"Take a look around — and when you're done, explore the rest of WordPress.com."
				) }
			</p>
			<ButtonRow>
				<Quit primary>{ translate( 'Got it.' ) }</Quit>
			</ButtonRow>
		</Fragment>
	) }
</Step>
```

## Finished!

You can see the finished tour in action by going to a URL like `http://calypso.localhost:3000/stats/insights/SITE_URL?tour=tutorialSitePreview`.

You'll have to replace SITE_URL with the URL of one of your sites.

## A Few More Tips

### Custom Styles

It's possible to pass custom styles to a step like so:

```JSX
<Step
	...
	style={ { marginTop: '-15px', zIndex: 1 } }
>
```

In this case, the automatic positioning was correctly pointing at the target, but the visual weight was off by a few pixels.

**Caveat:** Please use this sparingly or not at all. Minor fixes such as those presented above are fine, but the general Guided Tours style should be kept consistent across Calypso and all its tours.

### Adding a Delay

If your first step displays using an animation, you can effectively delay the start of the tour by adding an animationDelay to the `Step`'s styles. This could buy some important time for letting things render properly.

```JSX
style={ {
	animationDelay: '10s',
} }
```

**Caveat:** Please use this sparingly or not at all. Ask yourself whether what you are attempting to solve can't be solved with better selectors for `when`.

### Dealing with async

_Context, which you are free to skip:_ Roughly speaking, there are two kinds of on-demand loading in Calypso: code and data. **Code** is loaded in chunks thanks to code splitting, a feature powered by webpack; most commonly, chunks have to be loaded when the user requests to navigate to a new section, though it is possible to manually break down a section into different chunks and load them [asynchronously][async-load] for performance gains, as is [done in the Editor][async-load-usage]. **Data** is loaded, typically, by firing AJAX requests and handling their responses in or close to the _action_ layer of the Redux subsystem. Practically speaking, this means that a typical request for data will generate a series of Redux actions such as `REQUEST_FOOS`, `RECEIVE_FOOS`, `REQUEST_FOOS_SUCCESS`, `REQUEST_FOOS_FAILURE`. Specific parts of the UI will then "subscribe" to changes using `react-redux`'s `connect` helper.

_The issue:_ Guided Tours has built-in support for section-wise code splitting, meaning that it knows how to wait when Calypso has to wait for a chunk to arrive before rendering a section's UI, etc. However, upon a user's request to navigate to a new section, it is common that _both_ code and data need to be loaded before the UI is rendered. This duality can become confusing to developers and lead to undiagnosed bugs in new tours. Example:

1. A tour, `siteTitle`, has a step prompting the user to click _Settings_ on the sidebar.
2. Once the user navigates to `/settings` and that section is loaded, Guided Tours displays the next step, which points at a specific input field of that new view, prompting the user for the next action.

If neither the code chunk nor the site data required for `/settings` are available locally, there will be a race condition whereby the new chunk will be loaded and run, thus clearing the `isSectionLoaded` flag in Guided Tours, thus confirming the transition from the previous step to the new one and rendering that step's contents, **but** because the data itself hasn't been received yet, the full UI for `/settings` doesn't exist yet, so the new step won't have any `target`s (or won't have the correct/final ones) to position itself next to. The result is a grossly mispositioned step that will manifest itself to the user either a broken UI or as though the Guided Tour has abruptly quit. Usually, this will go **unnoticed in development**, as chunks are loaded locally with reltively low latency.

_The [fix][pr-10521]:_ We make Guided Tours "subscribe" to the corresponding data requests using its all-purpose [`actionLog`][action-log]: simply add the action type signaling the satisfaction of a data need — _e.g._, `RECEIVE_FOOS` or `REQUEST_FOOS_SUCCESS` — to the log's [white list][relevant-types]. Any change to `actionLog` triggers all of Guided Tours' view layer to update, thereby allowing a correct and timely positioning of steps.
