# Guided Tours API

Guided Tours are declared as a tree of JSX components.


## Tour

Tour is a React component that declares the top-level of a tour. It defines conditions for starting a tour and contains `<Step>` components as children.

### Props

* `name`: (string) Unique name of tour in camelCase.
* `version` (string): Version identifier. We use date string like "20161224".
* `path` (string or array, optional): Use this prop to limit tour only to some path prefix (or more prefixes if array). Example: `[ '/stats', '/settings' ]`
* `when` (function, optional): This is a redux selector function. Use this to define conditions for the tour to start.

## Step

Step is a React component that defines a single Step of a tour. It is represented as dark box on top of Calypso UI. Step can be positioned in many ways in relation to any DOM node in Calypso that is marked with `[data-tip-target]` attribute.

### Props

* `name`: (string) Unique identifier of the step.
* `target`: (string, optional) Target which this step belongs to and will be used for positioning. This prop is value is used to look up according `[data-tip-target]` in DOM. If omitted, `<body>` will be used as target. TODO: mention querySelector hack?, is body really default target?
* `placement`: (string, optional) Placement. Possible values: 'below', 'above', 'beside', 'center', 'middle', 'right'
* `arrow`: (string, optional) If defined, step will get arrow pointing to a direction. Available: 'top-left', 'top-center', 'top-right',
'right-top', 'right-middle', 'right-bottom', 'bottom-left', 'bottom-center', 'bottom-right', 'left-top', 'left-middle', 'left-bottom'
* `style`: (object, optional) Will be used as step's inline style.
* `when`: (function, optional) This is a redux selector that can prevent step from showing when it evaluates to false. Define `next` prop to tell Guided Tours name of the step it should skip to. If you omit this prop, step will be rendered as expected.
* `next`: (string, optional) Define this to tell Guided Tours name of the step it should skip to when `when` evaluates to false.

## ButtonRow

ButtonRow is a React component to display button controls in Step and takes care of their proper styling. To be used as the last child of Step to contain all available controls.

### Example

```jsx
<ButtonRow>
  <Next step="next-step" />
  <Quit />
</ButtonRow>
```

## Continue

Continue is a React component that you can use in Step to programmatically continue the tour to other step based on user interaction with Calypso. There are currently two ways to declare the condition to continue the tour.

- Binding an `onClick` listener to a DOM node marked as `[data-tip-target]`
- Redux selector function that evaluates to true in order to advance the tour

### Props

* `step`: (string) Name of the step the tour will advance to.
* `target`: (string, optional) Name of `[data-tip-target]` that would be watched.
* `click`: (bool, optional) If true, `onClick` will be listened on `target` DOM node.
* `hidden`: (bool, optional) If true, this will not render anything in Step, while functionality remains.
* `icon`: (string, optional) Name of Gridicon to show in custom message.
* `when`: (function, optional) Redux selector. Once it evaluates to true, tour will advance to `step`.

### Content

- text
- text + props.icon
- custom content

## Next

Link is a React component that shows a button that allows users to advance tour to another step. To be used inside of `<ButtonRow>`.

### Props

* `step`: (string) Name of the step the tour will advance to.

### Label

Default label is "Next". To override, place your label as a child.

### Example

```jsx
// with default label
<Next step="next-step" />
// or with a custom one
<Next step="next-step">Custom Label</Next>`
```

## Quit

Quit is a React component that shows a button that allows users to quit current tour. To be used inside of `<ButtonRow>`.

### Props

* `primary` (bool, optional) If true, button will be rendered as primary. Use only if Quit is the only available action.

### Label

Default label is "Quit". To override, place your label a child.

### Example

```jsx
// with default label
<Quit />

// with a custom label
<Quit>Custom Label</Next>`

// custom label + primary styling
<Quit primary>Custom Label</Next>`
```

## Link

Link is a React component that shows a Link to external page in Step. It takes care of the styling and makes sure the link always opens in a new browser tab. We usually use it in the last step of tour where we nudge user to explore the docs to learn more about the area we just covered with a tour.
