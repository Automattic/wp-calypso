Community Translator Components
===============================

## Translator Launcher

This component shows a button in the bottom right corner of the screen to allow the user to activate and deactivate the Community Translator.  It is only visible when the user has enabled the Community Translator, and is using a non-English interface language.  The launcher is also hidden if if the browser has a small screen or touch capabilities.
