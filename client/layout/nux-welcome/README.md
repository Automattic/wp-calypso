nux-welcome
===========

This module enables a welcome message to be shown at the top of calypso for new users who have just registered their first site. The message is persistent for users in a full-width screen and follows them from page-to-page in calypso until they dismiss it or their localStorage is cleared for whatever reason. In mobile or one-col browsers the welcome message is removed when the user dismisses it or upon navigating to any other page.
