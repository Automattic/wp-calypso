# JetpackHeader

The `JetpackHeader` component is intended to be used for co-branding of Jetpack flows. This may include things like Jetpack site connection or Jetpack-specific log in.

In cases where a partner has referred a new site, we'd want to co-brand the flow.

## Props

### partnerSlug (string) optional

An optional slug for the hosting partner. This will cause a partner-specific logo to be rendered.

### width (number) optional

An optional width for the Jetpack logo or partner logo groups that will override the defaults.
