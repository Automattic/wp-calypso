Query Application Passwords
===========================

`<QueryApplicationPasswords />` is a React component used to request the application passwords of the current user.

## Usage

Render the component without props. It does not accept any children, nor does it render any elements to the page.

```jsx
import QueryApplicationPasswords from 'components/data/query-application-passwords';

export default () => (
	<div>
		<QueryApplicationPasswords />
	</div>
);
```
