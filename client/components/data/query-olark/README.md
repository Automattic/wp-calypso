Query Olark
===========================

`<QueryOlark />` is a React component used to query whether Olark has loaded properly.

## Usage

Render the component without props. It does not accept any children, nor does it render any elements to the page.

```jsx
import QueryOlark from 'components/data/query-olark';

export default function() {
	return (
		<div>
			<QueryOlark />
		</div>
	);
}
```
