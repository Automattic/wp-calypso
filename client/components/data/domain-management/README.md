# DomainManagementData

A component that fetches data based on given props and then passes them to its children.

## Usage

Pass a component as a child of `<DomainManagementData />`. `DomainManagementData` will pass data to the given component, which is mounted as a child.
It will handle the data itself thus helping us to decouple concerns: i.e. fetching and displaying data. This pattern is also called [container components](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005).

```js
import React from 'react';
import DomainManagementData from 'calypso/components/data/domain-management';
import MyChildComponent from 'calypso/components/my-child-component';

// initialize rest of the variables

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<DomainManagementData
				component={ MyChildComponent }
				context={ context }
				needsDomains
				needsDomainInfo
				needsUsers
			/>
		);
	}
}

export default MyComponent;
```

Currently we have both Flux and Redux mixed. Props for loading data:

- `needsCart` - Loads the `CartStore` (Flux)
- `needsContactDetails` - Loads Contact Details for current user (Redux)
- `needsDomains` - Loads domain for currently selected site (Redux)
- `needsDomainInfo` - Loads `WapiDomainInfoStore` (Flux)
- `needsPlans` - Loads plans for given site (Redux)
- `needsProductsList` - Loads products list (Redux)
- `needsUsers` - Loads `UsersStore` (Flux)

The child component should receive processed props defined in `getStateFromStores()`. It's updated whenever the data it needs changes.
