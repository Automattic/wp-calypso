Foldable card
==============

This component is used to display a box that can be clicked to expand a hidden section with its contents.

#### How to use:

```js
import FoldableCard from 'components/foldable-card';

render() {
	return (
		<div>
			 <FoldableCard
				header={ 'title' }
			 >
			 	{ content }
			 </FoldableCard>
		</div>
	);
}
```

#### Props

* `header`: a string, HTML or component to show in the default header view of the box

#### Children
* `content`: a string, HTML or component to show in the expandable section of the box when it's expanded

##### Optional props
* `actionButton`: a component to substitute the regular expand button
* `actionButtonExpanded`: a component to substitute the regular expand button when the card is expanded. If not provided, we use `actionButton`
