# Async Loader

This component can be used to control the rendering of a React component that depends on a number of asynchronous requests or tasks that may fail.
It provides an interface for showing pending, success, and failure states separately for convenience and modularity of design but the low-level status of each input task can be used from a single component.
The asynchronous parts of the input are provided by an object holding keys whose associated values are `Promise` objects.
The resolved promises will be passed into the wrapped components and made available with the same keys as provided to the `asyncLoader` call.

## Usage

### Maintaining a consistent UI

There are times we want to asynchronously load UI components but we don't want to present a partial or interrupted UI.
So while the `<AsyncLoad />` wrapper is good for pulling in these components, it doesn't resolve the complexity issue caused when trying to wait until all of the pieces are available.
We're going to use the dynamic `import()` syntax to load our components and then only render when everything is ready.

In the absence of the loading component the async loader will render `null`.

```js
import { asyncLoader } from 'components/async-loader';

export default ( { siteId, currentSearch } ) => React.createElement( asyncLoader( {
	promises: {
		AuthorList: import( './author-list' ),
		Banner: import( './banner' ),
		PostList: import( './post-list' ),
	},
	success: ( { AuthorList, Banner, PostsList } ) => (
		<>
			<Banner />
			<AuthorList siteId={ siteId } />
			<PostList siteId={ siteId } search={ currentSearch } />
		</>
	),
} ) );
```

Note that can use this method for pulling in any module asynchronously.
Maybe we have a large utility library we want to pull in, such as the post normalizer, but we don't want to display until that chunk is in the browser.
We can add that utility module just as easily as we have added UI components through the dynamic import promise.

### Waiting on data

Other times it doesn't make sense to render a given UI until we have certain data.
In many places we'll find conditional logic peppered in to otherwise straightforward components.
Usually it looks like `if ( null == someData ) { return null; }`.
We can use the `asyncLoader` to separate the concern of waiting for data from the concern of rendering that data.

```js
import { asyncLoader } from 'components/async-loader';

export default props => React.createElement( asyncLoader( {
	promises: {
		data: waitForData( {
			plan: requestPlan( props.userId ),
			site: requestSiteInfo( props.siteId ),
			user: requestUserInfo( props.userId ),
		} ),
	},
	loading: () => <div>Loading profile information…</div>,
	success: ( { data: { plan, site, user } } ) => <UserProfile plan={ plan } site={ site } user={ user } />,
	failure: () => <div>Could not load necessary information. Please refresh the page to try again.</div>,
} ) );
```

### Waiting on tasks

In this example we'll defer rendering a component until translations have been loaded.
We don't use the data returned by the promise in this case because the framework handles translations, but we don't want to render our component before they are loaded.
Thus we're not passing any data to the success component.

```js
import { asyncLoader } from 'components/async-loader';

const getTranslations = slug => waitForData( {
	translations: requestTranslations( slug ),
} );

const Panel = asyncLoader( {
	promises: {
		translations: getTranslations( currentLocale )
	},
	success: () => <TranslatedThing />,
	loading: () => 'Loading…',
	failure: () => (
		<>
			<Notice>Could not load translations, proceeding with English.</Notice>
			<TranslatedThing />
		</>
	)
} );

context.primary = <Panel />;
```
