Product Card
=======

Product Card is a React component for rendering a box with product name, price, short description and additional
information.

It can have a [`<ProductCardOptions />`](#product-card-options) component passed as a child that will render product
purchase options under the product description.

In some cases, e.g. when a lower-tier product has been already purchased, an upgrade button can be displayed using a
[`<ProductCardAction />`](#product-card-action) component. Like the `<ProductCardOptions />` component, it should be
passed as a child to the `<ProductCard />`.

It's used e.g. on `my-plans` page near the bundle plans grid and is intended to render a product card (not a regular
plan).

See p1HpG7-7ET-p2 for more details.

### How to use the `<ProductCard />`

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ProductCard from 'components/product-card';

export default class extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<ProductCard
				title="Jetpack Scan"
				billingTimeFrame={ 'per year' }
				fullPrice={ 25 }
				description={
					<p>
						Automatic scanning and one-click fixes keep your site one step ahead of security
						threats. <a href="/plans">More info</a>
					</p>
				}
			/>
		);
	}
}
```

### <a name="how-purchase-prop-works"></a>How `purchase` prop works

The component can be in two visual and functional states:
* `purchase` prop is not set - the product plan prices will be rendered below the highlighted title. If the product
has purchase options, they will be listed below the description.
* `purchase` prop is set - the content area will not contain product options (if they exist).

### `<ProductCard />` props

The following props can be passed to the Product Card component:

* `billingTimeFrame`: ( string ) Billing time frame label
* `currencyCode`: ( string ) Currency code
* `description`: ( string | element ) Product description. It can be a string or a React element (e.g. `<Fragment>`)
* `discountedPrice`: ( number | array ) Discounted price of the product. If an array of 2 numbers is passed, it will be
 displayed as a price range
* `fullPrice`: ( number | array ) Full price of a product. If an array of 2 numbers is passed, it will be displayed as
 a price range
* `isPlaceholder`: ( bool ) Flag indicating if a product price is in a loading state and should be rendered as a
  placeholder
* `purchase`: ( object ) A purchase object, associated with the product. [Read more about the way this flag
 works](#how-purchase-prop-works)
* `subtitle`: ( string | element ) Product subtitle. It's used if the product has already been purchased, but can be
 used also in other use-cases. It can be a string or a React element (e.g. `<Fragment>`)
* `title`: ( string | element ) Product title. It can be a string or a React element (e.g. `<Fragment>`)
