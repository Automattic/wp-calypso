Form Text Input With Affixes
============================

This component is a wrapper around the default form text input that adds support for affixes, i.e. the ability to display a fixed part either at the beginning or at the end of the text input.

## Props

### `prefix`

Markup to be inserted at the beginning of the input.

### `suffix`

Markup to be appended at the end of the input.

### `noWrap`

A flag that prevents the prefix and suffix from wrapping when the component is displayed on small viewports. This basically disables the corresponding breakpoint.
