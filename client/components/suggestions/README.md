# Suggestions (JSX)

Suggestions is a component which works with `SearchCard` to display suggested search terms.

## Usage

`Suggestions` is passed an array of `suggestions` which will display in a list. The way this is usually implemented is to supply a list of possible values in the parent class, and filter these using the query in `SearchCard`, passing the remaining suggestions to the `<Suggestions />` component.

For example:

```jsx
import SearchCard from 'components/search-card';
import Suggestions from 'components/suggestions';

class SuggestionsExample extends Component {

	static hints = [ 'Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz' ];

	state = {
		query: '',
	};

	setSuggestionsRef = ref => ( this.suggestionsRef = ref );

	hideSuggestions = () => this.setState( { query: '' } );

	handleSearch = query => this.setState( { query: query } );

	handleKeyDown = event => this.suggestionsRef.handleKeyEvent( event );

	getSuggestions() {
		return SuggestionsExample.hints
			.filter( hint => this.state.query && hint.match( new RegExp( this.state.query, 'i' ) ) )
			.map( hint => ( { label: hint } ) );
	}

	suggestions = {
		return [
			{ label: 'Foo' },
			{ label: 'Bar' },
			{ label: 'Baz' },
		]
	};

	render() {
		return (
			<div className="docs__suggestions-container">
				<SearchCard
					disableAutocorrect
					onSearch={ this.handleSearch }
					onBlur={ this.hideSuggestions }
					onKeyDown={ this.handleKeyDown }
					placeholder="Type something..."
				/>
				<Suggestions
					ref={ this.setSuggestionsRef }
					query={ this.state.query }
					suggestions={ this.suggestions }
					suggest={ noop }
				/>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

```
