First View
==========

The React component is used to display a message to the user when they access
a section for the first time.

**Note: Currently, this component only works in the `/stats` section.
Specifically, it currently only works when placed within a `<StatsMain>` component.

In the near future, the `<Main>` component will be updated to support
`<FirstView>`.**
