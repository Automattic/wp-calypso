A [`Card` component](../../components/card) based on [`ActionPanel'](../../components/action-panel) designed to promote plan features and partnerships.

## Usage

import referralImage from 'assets/images/earn/referral.svg';

const PromoCardExample = () => {
	const img = {
		path: referralImage,
		alt: 'Using Props',
	};
	const clicked = () => alert( 'Clicked!' );
	return (
		<PromoCard title="Under-used Feature" image={ img } isPrimary={ false }>
			<p>
				This is a description of the action. It gives a bit more detail and explains what we are
				inviting the user to do.
			</p>
			<PromoCardCta
				cta={ {
					feature: FEATURE_MEMBERSHIPS,
					upgradeButton: { text: 'Upgrade!', action: clicked },
