# Marked Lines viewer

This component is designed to show contextualized lines from a file with
optional highlighting or marks to point out specific parts of one or more lines.

## Usage

```jsx
import MarkedLines from 'components/marked-lines';

return (
	<MarkedLines
		context={ {
			10: 'add :: Num a => a -> a -> a',
			11: 'add = (+)',
			15: 'solve a b = solution',
			16: '	where',
			17: '		solution = sum parts',
			18: '		{- ðŸ’© indices are in UCS-2 code units -}',
			19: '		sum = foldl add 0',
			20: '		parts = foo a b',
			58: '{- lines need not be contiguous -}',
			marks: {
				11: [ [ 6, 9 ] ],
				18: [ [ 23, 28 ] ],
				19: [
					[ 2, 5 ],
					[ 14, 17 ],
				],
			},
		} }
	/>
);
```

### Props

| Name        | Type     | Default | Description                               |
| ----------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `context`\* | `object` |         | Provides the line content and mark ranges |

### Additional usage information

The numeric keys of the object will be displayed as line numbers and the
values of those keys will display as the line at that line number.

The `marks` key will hold a similar data structure where the numeric keys
are line numbers and the value is a list of pairs of index-ranges which to
mark and highlight. The indices are measured in UCS-2 code points, meaning
that certain symbols (such as the heart emoji) count as two separate indices.

The indices are based on how Javascript natively indexes strings and can be
alternately generated as half the number of bytes necessary for UTF-16
encoding of the string.

Line numbers need not be contiguous which is useful if you want to show two
separate parts of a file - perhaps to highlight differences or similarities.
This component was originally designed to quickly show where possibly-malicious
threats in a file were found.
