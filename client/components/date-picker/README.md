## DatePicker

### Props

`initialMonth` - **optional** Date object that defines the month of the calendar. Default is `now`.

`selectedDay` - **optional** Moment instance to select the current day.

`timeReference` - **optional** Moment instance used to adjust the time when a day
is selected.

`events` - **optional** Array of events.

`className` - **optional** Add a custom class property.

`onSelectDay` - **optional** Called when day is selected by user.

`onMonthChange` - **optional** Called when month is changed by user.

`locale` - **optional** String representing the current locale slug (eg: `en`). Note that the default component `export`ed is already wrapped in the `localize` HOC which automatically sets this prop for you. Previously this prop was an object of utility overides. This has been moved to a dedicated `localUtils` prop (see below).

`localeUtils` - **optional** Object of [locale utility _overides_](http://react-day-picker.js.org/api/LocaleUtils) which are merged with the default utilities passed into the `react-day-picker` library. Previously this prop was named `locale`, but was moved to its own dedicated prop for API consistency with the React Day Picker library.
