Close on Escape
============

Allows for an ordered stack of components that carry out an action when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is pressed. Each instance will carry out their `onEscape` action before being removed from the stack on a first-in-last-out basis.

This is useful for components such as `<Dialog />` and `<Popover />`, particularly in flows that see multiple `Dialog`s that 'stack'.

## Usage

To use this component, either nest it inside of an existing component or as a sibling, passing it a function as `onEscape` to be called when <kbd>esc</kbd> is pressed.

```jsx
import CloseOnEscape from 'components/close-on-escape';

...

closeDialog() {
  // Take care of closing this component
}

render() {
  // Nested:

  return (
    <Dialog ... >
      <CloseOnEscape onEscape={ this.closeDialog } />
    </Dialog>
  );

  // Or as a sibling:

  return (
    <div>
      <CloseOnEscape onEscape={ this.closeDialog } />
      <Dialog ... />
    <div>
  );
}

...

```
