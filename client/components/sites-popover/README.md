# Sites Popover

This component wraps the [Site Selector](../site-selector) component in a [Popover](../popover), allowing a user to pick one of his sites from a list that pops up like a context menu e.g. when clicking on a button.

## Props

The component accepts props `visible`, `context`, `onClose`, and `position`. All of these props are passed on to Popover (`visible` is mapped to Popover's `isVisible`). For their documentation, please refer to [Popover's README.md](../popover/README.md).
