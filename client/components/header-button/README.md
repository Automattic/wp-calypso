HeaderButton
==================

This component is used to display a large button in the header area, adjacent
to elements like a `Search`. It takes an `icon` prop that is an ID of a
`Gridicon`, and a `label` prop that is used as the label of the button.  All
the other properties are passed to the `Button` component that is used to
implement this one.

#### How to use:

```js
import HeaderButton from 'components/header-button';

function MyHeader() {
	return (
		<div>
			<HeaderButton
				icon="plus-small"
				label="Add Plugin"
				href="/plugins/manage"
			/>
	  </div>
	);
}
```

#### Props

* `icon` : (string) ID of a `Gridicon` icon
* `label` : The text label of the button

All other props are passed to the underlying `Button`.
