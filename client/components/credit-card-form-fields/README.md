CreditCardFormFields
==============


`CreditCardFormFields` is a React component that is used to display a credit card form body with the following input fields:

* Credit card number
* Credit card expiration date
* Credit card verification code, also known as [CVV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_security_code)
* Credit card holder name
* Credit card holder country
* Credit card holder postal Code

Some of these fields use [masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_mask), i.e. rules that govern what a user is allowed to enter in a text box.

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import CreditCardFormFields from 'components/credit-card-form-fields';

class YourComponent extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<CreditCardFormFields
				card={ this.props.card }
				countriesList={ this.props.countriesList }
				eventFormName="Credit Card Form"
				isFieldInvalid={ this.isFieldInvalid }
				onFieldChange={ this.onFieldChange }
			/>
		);
	}
}
```

### `card`
