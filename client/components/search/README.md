search
======

Reusable search component with controls for opening and closing the search input field.

## Props

### onSearch
Callback to fire to obtain search results. By default this gets called `onChange`, which happens on each keypress. If `delaySearch` is also set, this function will only fire after the user has stopped typing for at least 400 milliseconds, which is useful to avoid unnecessary asynchronous fetches. Passes in a string matching the value of the field or `false` when the search field is closed.

### onSearchChange (optional)
This is only necessary if `delaySearch` is being used to delay a fetch callback, but you want to respond immediately to the updated value (e.g., show that the user is currently searching). Passes in a string matching the value of the field or `false` when the search field is closed.

### analyticsGroup
We track usage of the search component, so we need to know where search is being used. E.g., "Posts" for the search instance in the Posts page.

### initialValue (optional)
Use this to set the initial value of the field (_not the placeholder, which is different from the value_). Most cases should not require this. However this is necessary to populate the search box for example if a user is loading a bookmarked search results page with a url like:

`/posts?s=keyword`

### delaySearch (optional) boolean ( default false )
Use this prop to delay the `onSearch` callback until after the user has stopped typing. If `delaySearch` is false there is no delay between keyup and the `onSearch` callback. If the filtering is done asynchronously (i.e., via ajax request) `delaySearch` should be true to avoid a request on each keypress. The default delay is 300ms but can be customized using `delayTimeout`.

### delayTimeout (optional) number ( default 300 )
If `delaySearch` is true, this prop can be used to control the number of milliseconds used to determine when the user has stopped typing. It's a good idea to leave this at its default value unless there's a specific reason to change the timeout (e.g., a very expensive search may benefit from a longer timeout).

### pinned (optional)
Whether to display the search input from collapsed by default and pinned to the right of its container. If not set, the search input will show as already expanded.

### placeholder (optional)
The label to place inside the search field if/when empty. Defaults to a translated version of "Searchâ€¦".

### autoFocus (optional) bool ( default false )
This value is passed to the autoFocus attribute of the `<input>` element, and determines whether or not the input is automatically focused.

### disabled (optional) bool ( default false )
This value is passed to the disabled attribute of the `<input>` element, and determines whether or not the input is disabled.

### searching (optional) bool ( default false )
Whether to display a [`<Spinner />`](../spinner/) in place of the search icon.

## Methods

### getCurrentSearchValue()
Returns the current value of the search input element. While you will generally pass in a callback function which will be called whenever the search value is changed by the user, it can also be useful to query for the current search value directly.
