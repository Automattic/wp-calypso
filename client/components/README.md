Components
==========

Components are React components used for composing the UI of Calypso.

They come with their own styles defined [according to our guidelines](../../docs/coding-guidelines/css.md), and manually loaded from the [styles assets folder](../../assets/stylesheets/_components.scss). Structuring the user interface with these building blocks has several benefits â€” like allowing to quickly construct a view that is visually consistent with the rest of Calypso, and easier to iterate on.

Many of these components can be seen in action in our [DevDocs: UI Components](https://wpcalypso.wordpress.com/devdocs/design) section.
