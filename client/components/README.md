Components
==========

_Read the [documentation on components](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/components.md) for more in-depth information._

This place harbors shared React components used for composing the UI of Calypso. Components come with their own styles defined [according to our guidelines](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/css.md), and manually loaded from the [styles assets folder](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/_components.scss). Structuring the user interface with these building blocks has several benefits â€” like allowing to quickly construct a view that is visually consistent with the rest of Calypso, and easier to iterate on.

Some of these components can be seen in action in our [DevDocs: Design](https://wpcalypso.wordpress.com/devdocs/design) section.
