# Components

Components are React components used for composing the UI of Calypso.

They come with their own styles defined [according to our guidelines](../../docs/coding-guidelines/css.md), and manually loaded from the styles file in a component's folder: `component/style.scss` (as an example, [here is the styles file of the Badge component](./badge/style.scss)). Structuring the user interface with these building blocks has several benefits — like allowing to quickly construct a view that is visually consistent with the rest of Calypso, and easier to iterate on.

Many of these components can be seen in action in our [DevDocs: UI Components](https://wpcalypso.wordpress.com/devdocs/design) section.
