# State Selectors

A selector is simply a convenience function for retrieving data out of the global state tree. This page contains all available state selectors, which can be used as a helper in retrieving derived data from the global state tree.

To learn more about selectors, refer to the ["Our Approach to Data" document](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/HEAD/docs/our-approach-to-data.md#selectors)
