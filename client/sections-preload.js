/**
 * sections-preload
 *
 * This is a simple eventbus that sections.js listens to, to know when to preload sections.
 *
 * In days past, the preloader was part of sections.js. To preload a module you would import sections
 * and call preload directly. However, all of the require.ensure calls live in sections.js. This makes
 * webpack think that imported sections was also dependant on every other chunk. The cyclic dependencies
 * ballooned compile times and made module analysis very difficult.
 *
 * To break the dependency cycle, we introduced the dependency-free `sections-preload`.
