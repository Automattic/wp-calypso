# and should only change as often as the dependencies

# Build a "source" layer
#
# This layer is populated with up-to-date files from
# Calypso development.
#
# If package.json and npm-shrinkwrap are unchanged,
# `install-if-deps-outdated` should require no action.
# However, time is being spent in the build step on
# `install-if-deps-outdated`. This is because in the
# following COPY, the npm-shrinkwrap mtime is being
# updated, which is confusing `install-if-deps-outdated`.
# Touch after copy to ensure that this layer will
# not trigger additional install as part of the build
# in the following step.
